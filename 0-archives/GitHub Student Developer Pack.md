### From 1Password Support:
> As for redeeming the promotion multiple times, if you were to have multiple GitHub accounts both enrolled in the GitHub Global Campus program you would technically be able to redeem the promotion once for each account, however it is intended to be redeemed one time. If you are looking for additional discounts after the free year ends you can always check out the <a href="https://www.studentappcentre.com/App/1Password" rel="noopener" class="external-link" target="_blank"><u>50% off promotion</u></a> offered through the Student App Centre.

[Re: [#UUE-98455-221] I wanted to test the waters at Bitwarden and it isn't as good as 1Password so I am looking to switch back but I paid $10 for my annual fee to bitwarden so I was looking to get that credited to my account instead. Is that possible?](message:%3C909acc70-939a-4e2b-abdd-1e0ac920ce8d@me.com%3E)
