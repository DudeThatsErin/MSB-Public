# Front-End Staff Software Engineer - Austin, TX 78757 - Indeed.com

> ## Excerpt
> Steadily Insurance Agency

---
Steadily is an insurtech that insures landlords. We're two years old, just over 100 people, manage $6B in risk, and are intent on becoming the best and largest insurer of rental properties.

We exist to deliver fast, affordable insurance and to pay claims quickly and fairly. To do that, we hire the best engineers, actuaries, sales, and service people in the country to build the experience that we'd want if we were a client.

**What You Could Do:**

-   Build a mobile experience for people to buy insurance that is so simple/intuitive that your least-tech savvy relative with a flip-phone could use it without help
-   Create a claim app that uses phone camera and sensors to document the damage smartly
-   Design and implement an intuitive rating comparison tool that makes elaborate comparisons easy to understand
-   Combine property intelligence APIs sources to flag flood, fire, and vandalism risks

**What You'll Bring:**

-   **Experienced**: This isn't your first rodeo. There's no specific minimum number of years requirement, but we expect you to be able to dive into a complex codebase without too much spin-up. Past experience as a team lead is definitely a plus.
-   **Builder**: You like the product-side of engineering and have thoughtful opinions on what the user experience should be. You're not the type of engineer who wants a fully-fleshed out spec thrown over the wall for you to code.
-   **Pragmatic**: Let's say you have a tradeoff to make: Option A is to ship something fast using an off-the-shelf API on AWS; you won't learn that much and it only solves 80% of the problem, but it'll only take a few days. Option B is to invest about two weeks building a new library and internally-hosted service that perfectly solves the problem; as a bonus you can share it on Github and give a presentation about it at Reactathon. If you choose Option A 10/10 then you'll be at home here.
-   **Specific languages**: We don't really care if you've worked in our stack before as long as you're happy to learn it. If you're sharp enough to be on this team, you're sharp enough to learn any language or framework quickly.

**Our Stack:**

-   React with Next.js
-   Typescript
-   Python 3 / Django
-   Postgres
-   AWS
-   Kubernetes

**Compensation:**

-   Total compensation around $350,000
-   Salary of $250,000 - $300,000 annually

**Benefits:**

-   Equity in the company
-   Employer healthcare contribution
-   401K
-   Flexible Time Off
-   Health (HSA or FSA), vision, and dental insurance
