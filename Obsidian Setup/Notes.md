These are all of the notes I want to keep on my Obsidian Theme I am making. I am starting with snippets and then I'll move onto combining them all into a theme once I am happy (enough) with it and if other people seem to want it.

# Reference Files
These are files I can use to test the various functions... I am using dataview to present them in a list. Good way to test integration with dataview.
```dataview
LIST
FROM "Obsidian Setup/Misc Files"
```
# Links
These are links I need to remember to reference.
- [Obsidian CSS Snippets GitHub](https://github.com/r-u-s-h-i-k-e-s-h/Obsidian-CSS-Snippets/tree/Collection)
# List of Snippets
These are all of the snippets for this theme and what they do.
- N/A. I use my own theme [Moonstone](https://github.com/dudethatserin/moonstone) which should be available soon via the Theme Store inside Obsidian.
# List of Plugins
These are all of the plugins I use and why. I try to keep this list as small as possible.
> [!note]- [Obsidian Banners](https://github.com/noatpad/obsidian-banners)
> This allows me to have really nice banners in my Obsidian.

> [!note]- [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat)
> This allows me to have the latest version of plugins and themes that have not released to the Theme or Plugin store inside Obsidian. Like my theme or Obsidian Banners.

> [!note]- [Calendar](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-calendar-plugin)
> This allows me to easily create daily notes, switch between my daily notes, create weekly notes, as well as just see the current date within Obsidian.

> [!note]- [DataLoom](https://github.com/trey-wallis/obsidian-dataloom)
> Allows me to have Notion-like tables inside Obsidian.

> [!note]- [Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/)
> This allows me to query my files in a unique way so I can view them several different ways.

> [!note]- [Handwritten Notes](https://github.com/FBarrca/obsidian-handwritten-notes)
> Allows me to create handwritten notes/drawings via my iPad Pro and Apple Pencil. These are **not** searchable via OmniSearch + Text Extractor BUT I keep them organized in certain folders so I know where to find them and I don't need to search for them.

> [!note]- [Kanban](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban)
> This allows me to have a Kanban view of my tasks inside Obsidian.

> [!note]- [OmniSearch](https://github.com/scambier/obsidian-omnisearch) + [Text Extractor](https://github.com/scambier/obsidian-text-extractor)
> These allow me to search all plain text files like `.txt, .pdf (with text on it), .docx, .doc, .html, .css, and others`. That way I can find where they are located in my vault. I don't have all of these file types in my vault but I set it up in advance cause I never know when I may need it.

> [!note]- [Omnivore](https://docs.omnivore.app/integrations/obsidian.html)
> I use this to store my saved pages in Omnivore in a second offline place. **Most** of Omnivore is kept in its app but if I need to reference something in my vault, then I do that with this plugin.

> [!note]- [Tasks](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks)
> I use this to keep track of my life. I can't remember anything for the life of me. So, I use Tasks to help with that.

> [!note]- [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater)
> I use this to create my daily note template.
