- [ ] $36/year. I have to hide it from Josh starting in September
- [ ] Stability issues with Sync
- [ ] No bg sync
- [ ] Locked in so if something happens to the app/company (unlikely) then I am screwed.
- [ ] Overdue tasks turn red when it isn't a bad thing they are overdue.
- [ ] Siri integration is difficult
- [ ] Sync is not private
- [ ] Emails to task only upload a copy of the email to Todoist's servers as a comment. Finding the email to reply to it is therefore, harder.


## Apple Reminders Pros

- [ ] Free
- [ ] Can link websites in a nicer way
- [ ] Kanban or List View of Tasks
- [ ] Headers/Sections in every list
- [ ] Location-Based Reminders
- [ ] Overdue tasks turn red when it isn't a bad thing they are overdue.
- [ ] In order to force a sync I have to force close the app and reopen.
- [ ] Shortcuts are easy to work with
- [ ] repeating on random days works okay
- [ ] Sync is more reliable
- [ ] Works best with Siri
- [ ] Can complete any reminder early
- [ ] Best Link "look"


## Apple Reminders Cons

- [ ] Only on Apple Devices. When I do use my PC (rarely now that I have a reliable job) I won't be able to see my task list and will be forced to use my iPad or iPhone.
- [ ] No quick entry
- [ ] Only image attachments
- [ ] Locked in so if something happens to the app/company (unlikely) then I am screwed.
- [ ] Filters are barebones<br>- Can't filter out more than 1 list
- [ ] Notes are the only option, no comments
- [ ] Windows version sucks ass.<br>- Can't see "today" list<br>- Can't see any smart lists<br>- Can't view as kanban
- [ ] Sync is E2EE with Advanced Data Protection on but a bigger company so how much do you trust Apple to really not have the Encryption keys?
- [ ] Only task -> Subtask... no further
- [ ] No email to task
- [ ] Only 1 reminder/notification


## Obsidian Tasks Pros

- [ ] Available on every platform (not web)
- [ ] makes the $60/year sync subscription worth more.
- [ ] Any kind of attachment and I can make each task look however I want.
- [ ] MD is rendered fully.
- [ ] Kanban or List View of Tasks. Table view also with Tasks/Dataview.
- [ ] Headers/Sections anywhere
- [ ] All the filters
- [ ] no need to sync cause all of my tasks are local
- [ ] Adding multiple tasks works the best
- [ ] Sub-Sub-Sub-Sub (etc.) tasks.
- [ ] Can have comments anywhere
- [ ] repeating on random days works best
- [ ] Can complete any reminder early
- [ ] Most private since all files are local first and sync is E2EE
- [ ] Links look good but not as good as reminders


## Obsidian Tasks Cons

- [ ] Kanban is a mess on mobile and doesn’t seem to be developed anymore. Example A on plugin development.
- [ ] Tasks feel messier. I don’t feel as organized having everything together and I feel like I am fighting with my app to get it to work with my brain.
- [ ] No widgets, have to open app to see and mark off tasks.
- [ ] App is slow to open on phones sometimes (esp when vaults get bigger)
- [ ] Shortcuts are hard to work with.
- [ ] Doesn't work with Siri at all
- [ ] No email to task
- [ ] Priorities don't do much to differentiate tasks.<br>Unless you use CSS on the checkboxes but that is extra work.
- [ ] Harder to get set up
- [ ] Have to use 2 apps if I want reminders + tasks.
- [ ] Takes longer to enter tasks unless you memorize KB shortcuts and I don’t have enough brain power for that.
- [ ] Unable to have tasks with due TIMES as no reminders at set times. Helps keep events separate from tasks but what happens if I need that time (interviews and such)
- [ ] Relies on plugins which may or may not be continued to develop cause plugins are free vs these apps which have $ backing by its users
- [ ] Completed tasks clog up your files and if you want to delete them, you have to do it manually
- [ ] rescheduling tasks is harder than any app where you can right click and choose reschedule and choose a date. This you have to backspace and then type the date
- [ ] dates always have to be typed, there is no date picker


## Things 3 Pros

- [ ] Already paid for, IF I need the mac version, I can wait until BF and purchase for $37 assuming they have that again but even still it is a ONE TIME purchase vs a subscription. Yes, I would need to hide it but it isn't as bad as Todoist.
- [ ] Quick entry is good but you still have to remember all KB shortcuts or keep reaching for your mouse to enter tasks quickly.
- [ ] Someday/Anytime
- [ ] Prefer how overdue tasks work (they just stay on the list rather than turn red)
- [ ] Easy to import tasks from Todoist & Reminders.
- [ ] Shortcuts are easy to work with
- [ ] Sync is more reliable
- [ ] Siri works but I have to manually import into the app
- [ ] Emails to tasks link back to email to find them easier


## Things 3 Cons

- [ ] Only on Apple Devices. When I do use my PC (rarely now that I have a reliable job) I won't be able to see my task list and will be forced to use my iPad or iPhone.
- [ ] Prioritizing items is difficult. I have to use tags and filtering by tags on mobile is very difficult unless I rely on widgets which take 15+ min to sync unless I open the app immediately after.
- [ ] Locked in so if something happens to the app/company (unlikely) then I am screwed.
- [ ] No location based reminders
- [ ] In order to force a sync I have to force close the app and reopen.
- [ ] Notes are the only option, no comments
- [ ] repeating on random days is very difficult
- [ ] Can't complete repeating reminders early
- [ ] Sync is not private
- [ ] Links to anything don't look as nice as Todoist, Obsidian, or Reminders. Reminders having the best "look"
- [ ] Only task -> Subtask... no further
- [ ] Only 1 reminder/notification
- [ ] MD is rendered but still shown as well (annoying and ugly)
