## Spark Pros

- [ ] I login to 1 account and all of my other accounts are logged in
- [ ] Free to use
- [ ] Syncs notifications between devices so if I get and read/respond to an email on my desktop, they disappear on my phone/iPad.
- [ ] If I link an email to a note here in Obsidian, it will open on any and all of my devices because it is available there.


## Spark Cons

- [ ] Tries to force premium down your throat by advertising it everywhere. At $60/year none of the features are groundbreaking or necessary.
- [ ] They support ukraine when I don't.


## Outlook Pros

- [ ] Free with no premium advertisements


## Outlook Cons

- [ ] I have to set up each device and each email separately. Meaning I have to set up gmail, outlook, icloud, etc. individually on each device. I can't just login to 1 account like I can with spark and have everything signed in.


## Thunderbird Pros
