Relation:: [[App Seeker|App Seeker]]

## Notion Pros

- [ ] I can view the same information kanban, list, table, or gallery styles easily.
- [ ] Tasks look so much nicer. You get all the same information but the dates don't clutter the task and neither do the tags.
- [ ] Kanban looks nicer too.
- [ ] Tasks can live in multiple different databases at the same time with relational fields.


## Notion Cons

- [ ] Data isn't mine - I could lose it at any time for whatever Notion decides. It will just go poof and unless I exported it, I don't have my data anymore.
- [ ] Could lose my account cause I am using my old school email that I don't have access to. Since everything is online.
- [ ] No handwriting at all - only handwriting to text which SUCKS for me. Iâ€™ve never been able to use it.
- [ ] Can't have headers and smaller text in Notion
- [ ] Sometimes my questions go unanswered cause the community is limited to reddit... which SUCKS. I hate reddit.


## Obsidian Pros

- [ ] The data is mine and not being sent to advertisers for any reason (regardless of whether I opt-out)<br>Files are not lost.
- [ ] Offline first means that if I disconnect a device from the internet, that essentially makes a backup of all of my files.
- [ ] Has the capability to use the Apple Pencil even if it is not searchable or out of the box. It is still an option (as long as the document doesn't get over 200mb which largest I've ever had with my biggest document was 10mb)
- [ ] You can have headers and smaller text in kanban boards in obsidian like this:<br><br># Header<br>smaller text<br><br>## Second Header<br>smaller text
- [ ] Better community, questions answered faster or at all.


## Obsidian Cons

- [ ] Takes a lot of effort to see the information in a table style or gallery style. I only have access to kanban and list view easily (source mode of these kanban boards)
- [ ] Tasks look so obnoxious. I mean just look at this:<br>- [ ] Random task #tag ðŸ“… 2024-02-26 ðŸ›« 2024-02-02 âž• 2024-01-01
- [ ] Kanban looks so boring. I could probably change it with CSS but then Obsidian will update and break it and it requires work when Notion's just looks nice out of the box.
- [ ] Dynamic views are coming which will make it easier to see the same content multiple ways (first con) BUT that is to view the whole page (I assume), maybe you can have dataview properties inside of notes but then you have kanban lookin' like this: prop:: name date:: date name:: name tag:: tag and it looks just as ridiculous as tasks currently. You can link these to pages like it does in Notion but it takes an extra step to do that where Notion does it automatically from the get-go.
- [ ] Tasks can only live in Obsidian once unless you copy and paste.
- [ ] Syncing for free with git is a pain in the ass. Otherwise you have to pay $60/
