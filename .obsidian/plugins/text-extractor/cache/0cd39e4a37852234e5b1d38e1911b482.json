These questionnaires are designed for a clinician to assess a person’s risk, at that moment, for the two most common mental health conditions—depression and anxiety. The results are not a diagnosis. Only your doctor or care team can determine whether or not you have a condition. NEXT STEPS You may want to pay close attention to how you’re feeling over the next two weeks and retake the questionnaire to see how you are doing. The results of your questionnaire are not a diagnosis of any mental health condition.
