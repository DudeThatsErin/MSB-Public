A money tree will always spawn 3 bell bags. Each bag has the 3x amount buried same amount of bells, determined based on 10,000 or more how much was buried, as shown in this table. 3x% 10,000 bells You should only ever plant 10,000 & in a glowing spot to get the maximum profits over a long period of time because of the RNG nature of money trees. If you bury the maximum 99k & in a glowing spot for a year, you'll bury in total, 36,135,000 &. Only 30% of those will return 297k &, the other 70% will return only 30k &. Based on these percentages you will receive on average around 40.1M & in return, or about 4M & profit for the year. If you bury 10,000 & every day for a year, you will bury 3.65M & and receive 10.95M &, for a guaranteed profit of 7.3M @& for the year, and a guaranteed daily profit of 20k &.
