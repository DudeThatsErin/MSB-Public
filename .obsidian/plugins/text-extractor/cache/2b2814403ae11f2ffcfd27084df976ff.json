You can find several chests throughout the dungeon as well as two guaranteed chests at the end. O Dungeons come in tiers, with each dungeon type having a different pool of Alpha Pals. At the end of each ' RETREAT Y| dungeon is one guaranteed Alpha version of a Pal. AGAIN! There is a bug which occurs where, i the boss Pal isn' the type you want, you can walk about one and a 2 Bl haif rooms away then return and it wil be replaced with another from the same Dungeon pool.

For the early game, the dungeons tend to contain large deposits of Paladium ) which is extremely helpful if the dungeon is close to a Fast Travel point. iZ Contents -~ 1. Dungeon Layouts 3 ; 2. Exploring the Dungeon f‘ \\orw) z 3. Pal Encounters N SHLIST 4. Dungeon Final Chest Loot Now! Dungeon Layouts Dungeons use one of a select few layouts. Based on which rooms you encounter after the entrance, itis trivial to determine which direction the boss is located in. Exploring the Dungeon There are a few handy tips that can be used when exploring the dungeons: - Leaving a cheap and disposable item in the rooms you have already explored, such as a Paladium Fragment, can be a very helpful means of navigation. - Bringing a fast and small ground mount willtrivialize your traversal of the dungeons. Currently the best Pal for the job is Fengelope, which has the ability to double-jump. For those who plan to do a lot of dungeon exploring, it is suggested to breed a Fengelope with any combination of Swift, Runner, and Legend Passive Skill, as these will give 20%, 20%, and 15% movement speed respectively. Itis quite common for there to be a passage that is flooded with water before the boss room. Whilst not every flooded passage is the correct way, it is more likely to be than other passages.
