Passing Down Passive Skills EAR L] Breeding Farm Main article: Breeding Farm The Breeding Farm is a Technology that allows any two Pals to breed with each other (even completely different species) as long as they are of the opposite gender. It is unlacked at level 19, and requires 100 = Wood, 20 € Stone, and 50 \" Fiber to craft. In order to assign Pals to produce an egg together, the player must pick them up using the \"Pick Up\" button (default: V) and drop them inside the Breeding Farm. Once they have been successfully assigned, they will wander inside the Breeding Farm until manually removed again. Once two opposite-gendered Pals have been assigned to the Breeding Farm, the UI will state \"Love is blossoming between the two Pals\", and a progress bar will appear. In order for Pals to successfully lay an egg, one or more pieces of Cake will need to be placed in the wooden chest located on the right side of the Breeding Farm's fence. Keep in mind that the progress bar will start and continue to rise until full, regardless of the presence of Cake. However, Pals will not lay an egg until there is Cake in the Breeding Farm's chest. Cake placed in the Breeding Farm's chest does not spoil. Breeding Conditions As of launch, any Pal species can breed with any other Pal species. However, this will lead to a seemingly random Pal being generated with none of the parent's stats. The random Pal has a much higher chance of being a weaker, early game Pal than any mid to late game Pal. This is based off a \"child rank\" obtained from calculating the ranks of both the parents. A breeding combination list has been linked here “*(you can click here * to make a copy of the full breeding list spreadsheet for easier use). In order for the breeding to commence, there must be a male and female Pal in the Breeding Farm. As there is no cooldown, you can have Pals breed indefinitely as long as cake is in the farm's crate. This allows for a faster experience when breeding for variants. N, e N e A","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":"eng"}
