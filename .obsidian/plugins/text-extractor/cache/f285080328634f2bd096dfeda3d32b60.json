Al of these require specific Pal Gear to be unlocked and crafted at a Pal Gear Workbench in order to be used. While a Pal is mounted, it will not attack enemies automatically. Instead, the user is provided with a set of 5{‘*‘: AN O Keybinds to use each of the Pal's assigned skills manually. This can be very useful as it allows the playerto .~ % 1 TR 7 control how the Pal behaves in combat. %. 2= - j \" Mount Partner Skill Effects :;lll \\.‘ Na: S « Some Passive Skills, namely Nimble, Runner, Swift, and Legend, all increase a Pal's movement speed. 'DEMONST YOUR’ This does increase speed while mounted, and these passive skills stack with each other for even more (MASTERY[OFMAGI] speed, so breeding is important to creating an efficient Mount. « Some Pals receive an increase in Mount Speed when their Partner Skill s leveled up via the Pal Essence & Condenser. Other Pals which do not gain Mount Speed this way will generally increase some other THE-WITCH-OF bonus such as a damage boost while riding. HKNIS[AND x * When moving over water, Running mounts cannot sprint, will slowly lose stamina over time, and will %t \\ start taking drowning damage once their stamina completes. This can fully incapacitate the Pal forcing i j WS N it to retreat and kicking the player off the mount. NaaY Vi o Swimming and Flying mounts do not receive this stamina penalty when moving over water. = }“ % « Flying mounts can ascend slowly by holding Space. This costs stamina, and it also costs stamina to stay airborne, but allows the player to reach higher ledges with ease. If the mount runs out of stamina, it will quickly descend, and the player will be unable to ascend untilthe stamina meter refills again. The player can also manually descend slowly by holding Ctrl. =N \" « AtPartner Skill Level 1, %, Necromus is the fastest running mount, 4 Azurobe s the fastest o S swimming mount, and Jetragon is the fastest flying mount. e g gﬁ i © AtPartner Skill Level 5, 4 Necromus gains +20% speed, but this is still not faster than Jetragon - *\"ﬁ, \\]g‘# i 2 i Z( Partner Skl}ll RN ‘ n o g BT t Partner Skill Level 5, Jormuntide gains +20% speed, making it a faster swimming mount than (LIVEVE(I A Azurobe. © Jetragon s the fastest mount in the game, despite not gaining any mount speed with Partner skl levels. « Some Pals change the Player's attack type to a specific element. These abilities also increase the player's damage deal by +509%/+55%/+65%/+80%/+100% based on Partner Skilllevel. « Some Pals increase the damage dealt by certain elements. These generally only affect the Pal's damage dealt, and increase damage dealt by +50%/+55%/+65%/+80%/+100% based on Partner Skilllevel. © Frostallionand Frostallion Noct are unique in that they both change the Player's attack type and increase damage dealt by specific elements. I this case, both the player and the Pal (when using attacks of the matching type) will receive the damage bonus. « Some Pals provide a bonus to mining Ores, breaking boulders, or chopping trees while mounted. These bonuses only apply to the Pal tself (via sing attacks on trees or rocks) and not the player's held weapons. + Rushoaris the first Mount available to the Player, with the Technology for its required Pal Gear unlocked at Level 6. + Nitewing is the first Flying Mount available to the Player, with the Technology for its required Pal Gear unlocked at Level 15.
