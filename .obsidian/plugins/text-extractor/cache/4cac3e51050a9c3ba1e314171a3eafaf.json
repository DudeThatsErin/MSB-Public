Sleep 10. Guilds Shield The player's Shield is represented by a blue bar placed over the top of their heaith. Damage dealt to the player is dealt to the player's Shield instead; additionally, large hits which exceed the player's current Shield do not \"overflow into the player's Health, thus guaranteeing the player survives at least one hit. Partially or fully depleted shields will recover over time, faster than the players health does. The player has 0 Shield by default, and they need to equip an item to their Shield slot in order to increase it. The valid Shield items include: Shield Amount % Common Shield 100 % MegasShield 260 % Gigashield 540 % Hyper Shield 1045 Health Health is represented by a green bar and a heart icon. When the player's Health reaches 0, they are downed and will drop a Death Chest. ‘Going Down If a player's Health goes down to 0, they will go down if a ¥ Guild member is online and currently alive. Otherwise, they will die. Death When a player dies, they drop the items in their inventory and the Pals in their party. The inventory will be stored in a small bag, called Death Chest by the game files. The death chest and Pals dropped will be marked on the map and compass witha 3¢ icon, and a beacon that can be seen from a far distance will be shown to the player, untilthey or a guild member laims the bag and its items. If the world settings allow it, other players may also take the bag and Pals. The despawn timer for the bag and Pals are unknown. Ttems dropped can be picked at any elevation, as long as the player is close to the beacon. Hunger Food is represented by an orange bar and a bread icon. The player must consume Food in order to keep Hunger at bay, and if the player's Food depletes too much, the player's stats will decrease, and eventually they will start to take starvation damage. Note that starvation damage cannot down the Player or their Pals. Temperature Temperature is represented by a notched semi-circle with an arrow pointing in it. In extremely hot or cold environments, the arrow will move in the respective direction, and if the arrow s in one of the colored rectangles, the player will take damage over time, ignoring Shields. The intensity of the damage over time is indicated by the color of the rectangle. Equipping certain Armor and Accessories will increase the player's tolerance for extreme temperatures, increasing the temperature required to take damage and decreasing the damage taken in those temperatures. Additionally, some Mounts provide immunity to Heat, Cold, or both. Inventory Main article: Items Players can make use of items, such as tools, Food and Weapons.
