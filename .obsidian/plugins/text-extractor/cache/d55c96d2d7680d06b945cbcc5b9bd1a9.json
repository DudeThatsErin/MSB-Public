Values greater than the upper limit of our reference range are considered \\\"Normal\\\" in accordance with guidance from the Tietz Textbook on Clinical Chemistry, which states that values greater than the upper limit of the reference range are encountered in any condition associated with younger than normal RBC's (as in hemolytic anemias not due to G6PD deficiency), but are of no clinical significance. Specimen: 3-5 mL whole blood (EDTA tube,Lavender top - do not use twist-off caps). Do not freeze G6PD samples. Refrigerated samples are good for only 7 days; ship ASAP after collection. Excessive leukocytes or platelets, which are high in G6PD, may interfere in the assay. Reticulocytes have higher G6PD levels than mature erythrocytes, so samples should not be collected after a severe hemolytic crisis. G6PD reported value is a calculation based on G6PD and hemoglobin values. This test was developed and its performance characteristics evaluated by SAMMC Reference Chemistry Laboratory. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food Drug Administration (FDA). FDA does not require this test to go through premarket FDA review. The test is used for clinical purposes and should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (\\\"CLIA\\\") as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing.

BORDERLINE HIGH RISK: 100-159 mg/dL HIGH RISK: 160 mg/dL and greater Numerous clinical studies point to LDL cholesterol as the key factor in the pathogenesis of artherosclerosis and coronary artery disease, while HDL +cholesterol has often been observed to have a protective effect. Even within the normal range of total cholesterol concentrations, an increase in LDL cholesterol can occur with an associated increased risk for coronary artery disease.
