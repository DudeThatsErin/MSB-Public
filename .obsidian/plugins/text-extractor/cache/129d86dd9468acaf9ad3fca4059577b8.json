If you do have to sit down for long periods - perhaps for work - you can provide your legs with relief by regularly elevating them several times a day. Sitting positions in which the flow of blood is impeded, when you cross your legs, for example, should be avoided. During pregnancy, you should also refrain from wearing high heels. At night in particular, your legs can be supported with a pillow, for example. You should also pay attention to a healthy and balanced diet during pregnancy - not only for the benefit of your child, but also for your legs - because too much weight gain puts additional strain on the veins. Staying hydrated is just as crucial - water, tea or low-calorie drinks are an ideal choice - because fluid is important for ci@on and the metabolism. /N & bauerfeind-group.com","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
