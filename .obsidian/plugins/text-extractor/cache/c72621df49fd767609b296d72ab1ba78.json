{"path":"99-Archives/LeaseRenewalAgreement_9112024.pdf","text":"FLOOD DISCLOSURE NOTICE In accordance with Texas law, we are providing the following flood disclosure: • We  are or  are not aware that the unit you are renting is located in a 100-year floodplain. If neither box is checked, you should assume the unit is in a 100-year floodplain. Even if the unit is not in a 100-year floodplain, the unit may still be susceptible to flooding. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) maintains a flood map on its Internet website that is searchable by address, at no cost, to determine if a unit is located in a flood hazard area. Most renter’s insurance policies do not cover damages or loss incurred in a flood. You should seek insurance coverage that would cover losses caused by a flood. • We  are or  are not aware that the unit you are renting has flooded (per the statutory definition below) at least once within the last five years. As defined in Texas Property Code 92.0135(a)(2), “flooding” means “a general or temporary condition of a partial or complete inundation of a dwelling caused by: (A) the overflow of inland or tidal waters; (B) the unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff or surface waters from any established water source such as a river, stream, or drainage ditch; or (C) excessive rainfall.” Signatures of All Residents Signature of Owner or Owner’s Representative Date Texas Apartment Association X X Joshua Skidds Erin Skidds This Lease is valid only if filled out before January 1, 2026.

Page 2 of 6 LEASE TERMS AND CONDITIONS 1. Definitions. The following terms are commonly used in this Lease: 1.1. “Residents” are those listed in “Residents” above who sign this Lease and are authorized to live in the apartment. 1.2. “Occupants” are those listed in this Lease who are also autho- rized to live in the apartment, but who do not sign this Lease. 1.3. “Owner” may be identified by an assumed name and is the owner only and not property managers or anyone else. 1.4. “Including” in this Lease means “including but not limited to.” 1.5. “Community Policies” are the written apartment rules and policies, including property signage and instructions for care of our property and amenities, with which you, your occupants, and your guests must comply. 1.6. “Rent” is monthly base rent plus additional monthly recurring fixed charges. 1.7. “Lease” includes this document, any addenda and attachments, Community Policies and Special Provisions. 2. Apartment. You are leasing the apartment listed above for use as a private residence only. 2.1. Access. In accordance with this Lease, you’ll receive access information or devices for your apartment and mailbox, and other access devices including: __________ ______________ _______________________________________________ ______________________________________________. 2.2. Measurements. Any dimensions and sizes provided to you relating to the apartment are only approximations or estimates; actual dimensions and sizes may vary. 2.3. Representations. You agree that designations or accredi- tations associated with the property are subject to change. 3. Rent. You must pay your Rent on or before the 1st day of each month (due date) without demand. There are no exceptions regarding the payment of Rent, and you agree not paying Rent on or before the 1st of each month is a material breach of this Lease. 3.1. Payments. You will pay your Rent by any method, manner and place we specify in accordance with this Lease. Cash is not acceptable without our prior written permission. You cannot withhold or offset Rent unless authorized by law. We may, at our option, require at any time that you pay Rent and other sums due in one single payment by any method we specify. 3.2. Application of Payments. Payment of each sum due is an independent covenant, which means payments are due regardless of our performance. When we receive money, other than water and wastewater payments subject to government regulation, we may apply it at our option and without notice first to any of your unpaid obligations, then to accrued rent. We may do so regardless of notations on checks or money orders and regardless of when the obligations arose. All sums other than Rent and late fees are due upon our demand. After the due date, we do not have to accept any payments. 3.3. Late Fees. If we don’t receive your monthly base rent in full when it’s due, you must pay late fees as outlined in Lease Details. 3.4. Returned Payment Fee. You’ll pay the fee listed in Lease Details for each returned check or rejected electronic payment, plus initial and daily late fees if applicable, until we receive full payment in an acceptable method. 3.5. Utilities and Services. You’ll pay for all utilities and services, related deposits, and any charges or fees when they are due and as outlined in this Lease. Television channels that are provided may be changed during the Lease term if the change applies to all residents. If your electricity is interrupted, you must use only battery- operated lighting (no flames). You must not allow any utilities (other than cable or Internet) to be cut off or switched for any reason—including disconnection for not paying your bills—until the Lease term or renewal period ends. If a utility is individually metered, it must be connected in your name and you must notify the provider of your move- out date. If you delay getting service turned on in your name by this Lease’s start date or cause it to be transferred back into our name before you surrender or abandon the apartment, you’ll be liable for the charge listed above (not to exceed $50 per billing period), plus the actual or estimated cost of the utilities used while the utility should have been billed to you. If your apartment is individually metered and you change your retail electric provider, you must give us written notice. You must pay all applicable provider fees, including any fees to change service back into our name after you move out. 3.6. Lease Changes. Lease changes are only allowed during the Lease term or renewal period if governed by Par. 10, specified in Special Provisions in Par. 32, or by a written addendum or amendment signed by you and us. At or after the end of the initial Lease term, Rent increases will become effective with at least 5 days plus the number of days’ advance notice contained in Box F on page 1 in writing from us to you. Your new Lease, which may include increased Rent or Lease changes, will begin on the date stated in any advance notice we provide (without needing your signature) unless you give us written move-out notice under Par. 25, which applies only to the end of the current Lease term or renewal period. 4. Automatic Lease Renewal and Notice of Termination. This Lease will automatically renew month-to-month unless either party gives written notice of termination or intent to move out as required by Par. 25 and specified on page 1. If the number of days isn’t filled in, no- tice of at least 30 days is required. 5. Security Deposit. The total security deposit for all residents is due on or before the date this Lease is signed. Any animal deposit will be designated in an animal addendum. Security deposits may not be ap- plied to Rent without our prior written consent. 5.1. Refunds and Deductions. You must give us your advance notice of move out as provided by Par. 25 and forwarding address in writing to receive a written description and itemized list of charges or refund. In accordance with this Lease and as allowed by law, we may deduct from your security deposit any amounts due under this Lease. If you move out early or in response to a notice to vacate, you’ll be liable for rekeying charges. Upon receipt of your move-out date and forwarding address in writing, the security deposit will be returned (less lawful deductions) with an itemized accounting of any deductions, no later than 30 days after surrender or abandonment, unless laws provide otherwise. Any refund may be by one payment jointly payable to all residents and distributed to any one resident we choose, or distributed equally among all residents. 6. Insurance. Our insurance doesn’t cover the loss of or damage to your personal property. You will be required to have liability insur- ance as specified in this Lease unless otherwise prohibited by law. If you have insurance covering the apartment or your personal belong- ings at the time you or we suffer or allege a loss, you agree to require your insurance carrier to waive any insurance subrogation rights. Even if not required, we urge you to obtain your own insurance for losses due to theft, fire, flood, water, pipe leaks and similar occurrenc- es. Most renter’s insurance policies don’t cover losses due to a flood. 7. Reletting and Early Lease Termination. This Lease may not be ter- minated early except as provided in this Lease. 7.1. Reletting Charge. You’ll be liable for a reletting charge as listed in Lease Details, (not to exceed 85% of the highest monthly Rent during the Lease term) if you: (A) fail to move in, or fail to give written move-out notice as required in Par. 25; (B) move out without paying Rent in full for the entire Lease term or renewal period; (C) move out at our demand because of your default; or (D) are judicially evicted. The reletting charge is not a termination, cancellation or buyout fee and does not release you from your obligations under this Lease, including liability for future or past-due Rent, charges for damages or other sums due. The reletting charge is a liquidated amount covering only part of our damages—for our time, effort, and expense in finding and processing a replacement resident. These damages are uncertain and hard to ascertain—particularly those relating to inconvenience, paperwork, advertising, showing apartments, utilities for showing, checking pros- pects, overhead, marketing costs, and locator-service fees. You agree that the reletting charge is a reasonable estimate of our damages and that the charge is due whether or not our reletting attempts succeed. 7.2. Early Lease Termination Option Procedure. In addition to your termination rights referred to in 7.3 or 8.1 below, if this provision applies under Lease Details, you may opt to terminate this Lease prior to the end of the Lease term if all of the following occur: (a) as outlined in Lease Details, you give us written notice of early termination, pay the Early Termina- tion Option fee in full and specify the date by which you’ll move out; (b) you are not in default at any time and do not hold over; and (c) you repay all rent concessions, credits or discounts you received during the Lease term. If you are in default, the Lease remedies apply. 7.3. Special Termination Rights. You may have the right under Texas law to terminate this Lease early in certain situations involving military deployment or transfer, family violence, certain sexual offenses, stalking or death of a sole resident. 8. Delay of Occupancy. We are not responsible for any delay of your occupancy caused by construction, repairs, cleaning, or a previous resident’s holding over. This Lease will remain in force subject to (1) abatement of Rent on a daily basis during delay, and (2) your right to terminate this Lease in writing as set forth below. Rent abatement and Lease termination do not apply if the delay is for cleaning or re- pairs that don’t prevent you from moving into the apartment. 8.1. Termination. If we give written notice to you of a delay in occupancy when or after this Lease begins, you may termi- nate this Lease within 3 days after you receive written notice. If we give you written notice before the date this Lease begins and the notice states that a construction or other delay is expected and that the apartment will be ready for you to occupy on a specific date, you may terminate this Lease within 7 days after receiving written notice. After proper termination, you are entitled only to refund of any deposit(s) and any Rent you paid. Fob Apartment Lease Contract ©2023, Texas Apartment Association, Inc. Page 3 of 6 9. Care of Unit and Damages. You must promptly pay or reimburse us for loss, damage, consequential damages, government fines or charg- es, or cost of repairs or service in the apartment community because of a Lease violation; improper use, negligence, or other conduct by you, your invitees, your occupants, or your guests; or, as allowed by law, any other cause not due to our negligence or fault, except for damages by acts of God to the extent they couldn’t be mitigated by your action or inaction. Unless damage or wastewater stoppage is due to our negligence, we’re not liable for—and you must pay for—repairs and replace- ments occurring during the Lease term or renewal period, includ- ing: (A) damage from wastewater stoppages caused by improper objects in lines exclusively serving your apartment; (B) damage to doors, windows, or screens; and (C) damage from windows or doors left open. RESIDENT LIFE 10. Community Policies. Community Policies become part of this Lease and must be followed. We may make changes, including addi- tions, to our written Community Policies, and those changes can be- come effective immediately if the Community Policies are distributed and applicable to all units in the apartment community and do not change the dollar amounts owed under this Lease. 10.1. Photo/Video Release. You give us permission to use any photograph, likeness, image or video taken of you while you are using property common areas or participating in any event sponsored by us. 10.2. Disclosure of Information. At our sole option, we may, but are not obligated to, share and use information related to this Lease for law-enforcement, governmental, or business purposes. At our request, you authorize any utility provider to give us information about pending or actual connections or disconnections of utility service to your apartment. 10.3. Guests. We may exclude from the apartment community any guests or others who, in our sole judgment, have been violating the law, violating this Lease or our Community Policies, or disturbing other residents, neighbors, visitors, or owner representatives. We may also exclude from any outside area or common area anyone who refuses to show photo identification or refuses to identify himself or herself as a resident, an authorized occupant, or a guest of a specific resident in the community. Anyone not listed in this Lease cannot stay in the apartment for more than _______ days in one week without our prior written consent, and no more than twice that many days in any one month. If the previous space isn’t filled in, 2 days total per week will be the limit. 10.4. Notice of Convictions and Registration. You must notify us within 15 days if you or any of your occupants: (A) are convicted of any felony, (B) are convicted of any misdemeanor involving a controlled substance, violence to another person, or destruction of property, or (C) register as a sex offender. Informing us of a criminal conviction or sex-offender registration doesn’t waive any rights we may have against you. 10.5. Odors, Noise and Construction. You agree that odors and smells (including those related to cooking), everyday noises or sounds related to repair, renovation, improvement, or construction in or around the property are all a normal part of a multifamily living environment and that it is impractical for us to prevent them from penetrating your apartment. 11. Conduct. You agree to communicate and conduct yourself in a law- ful, courteous and reasonable manner at all times when interacting with us, our representatives and other residents or occupants. Any acts of unlawful, discourteous or unreasonable communication or conduct by you, your occupants or guests is a breach of this Lease. You must use customary diligence in maintaining the apartment, keeping it in a sanitary condition and not damaging or littering the common areas. Trash must be disposed of at least weekly. You will use your apartment and all other areas, including any balconies, with reasonable care. We may regulate the use of passageways, patios, balconies, porches, and activities in common areas. 11.1. Prohibited Conduct. You, your occupants, and your guests will not engage in certain prohibited conduct, including the following activities: (a) criminal conduct; manufacturing, delivering, or possessing a controlled substance or drug parapher- nalia; engaging in or threatening violence; possessing a weapon prohibited by state law; discharging a firearm in the apartment community; or, except when allowed by law, displaying or possessing a gun, knife, or other weapon in the common area, or in a way that may alarm others; (b) behaving in a loud, obnoxious or dangerous manner; (c) disturbing or threatening the rights, comfort, health, safety, or convenience of others, including us, our agents, or our representatives; (d) disrupting our business operations; (e) storing anything in closets containing water heaters or gas appliances; (f) tampering with utilities or telecommunication equipment; (g) bringing hazardous materials into the apartment community; (h) using windows for entry or exit; (i) heating the apartment with gas-operated appliances; (j) making bad-faith or false allegations against us or our agents to others; (k) smoking of any kind, that is not in accordance with this Lease; (l) using glass containers in or near pools; or (m) conducting any kind of business (including child-care services) in your apartment or in the apartment community—except for any lawful business conducted “at home” by computer, mail, or telephone if customers, clients, patients, employees or other business associates do not come to your apartment for business purposes. 12. Animals. No living creatures of any kind are allowed, even tempo- rarily, anywhere in the apartment or apartment community un- less we’ve given written permission. If we allow an animal, you must sign a separate Animal Addendum and, except as set forth in the ad- dendum, pay an animal deposit and applicable fees and additional monthly rent, as applicable. An animal deposit is considered a gener- al security deposit. You represent that any requests, statements and representations you make, including those for an assistance or sup- port animal, are true, accurate and made in good faith. Feeding stray, feral or wild animals is a breach of this Lease. 12.1. Removal of Unauthorized Animal. We may remove an unauthorized animal by (1) leaving, in a conspicuous place in the apartment, a written notice of our intent to remove the animal within 24 hours; and (2) following the procedures of Par. 14. We may: keep or kennel the animal; turn the animal over to a humane society, local authority or rescue organization; or return the animal to you if we consent to your request to keep the animal and you have completed and signed an Animal Addendum and paid all fees. When keeping or kenneling an animal, we won’t be liable for loss, harm, sickness, or death of the animal unless due to our negligence. You must pay for the animal’s reasonable care and kenneling charges. 12.2. Violations of Animal Policies and Charges. If you or any guest or occupant violates the animal restrictions of this Lease or our Community Policies, you’ll be subject to charges, damages, eviction, and other remedies provided in this Lease, including animal violation charges listed in Lease Details from the date the animal was brought into your apartment until it is removed. If an animal has been in the apartment at any time during your term of occupancy (with or without our consent), we’ll charge you for all cleaning and repair costs, including defleaing, deodorizing, and shampooing. Initial and daily animal-violation charges and animal-removal charges are liquidated damages for our time, inconvenience, and overhead in enforcing animal restrictions and Community Policies. 13. Parking. You may not be guaranteed parking. We may regulate the time, manner, and place of parking of all motorized vehicles and other modes of transportation, including bicycles and scooters, in this Lease. In addition to other rights we have to tow or boot vehicles under state law, we also have the right to remove, at the expense of the vehicle owner or operator, any vehicle that is not in compliance with this Lease. 14. When We May Enter. If you or any other resident, guest or occupant is present, then repair or service persons, contractors, law officers, government representatives, lenders, appraisers, prospective resi- dents or buyers, insurance agents, persons authorized to enter under your rental application, or our representatives may peacefully enter the apartment at reasonable times for reasonable business purposes. If nobody is in the apartment, then any such person may enter peace- fully and at reasonable times (by breaking a window or other means when necessary) for reasonable business purposes if written notice of the entry is left in a conspicuous place in the apartment immediately after the entry. We are under no obligation to enter only when you are present, and we may, but are not obligated to, give prior notice or make appointments. 3 15. Requests, Repairs and Malfunctions. 15.1. Written Requests Required. If you or any occupant needs to send a request—for example, for repairs, installations, services, ownership disclosure, or security-related matters— it must be written and delivered to our designated representative in accordance with this Lease (except for fair-housing accommodation or modification requests or situations involving imminent danger or threats to health or safety, such as fire, smoke, gas, explosion, or crime in progress). Our written notes regarding your oral request do not constitute a written request from you. Our complying with or responding to any oral request doesn’t waive the strict requirement for written notices under this Lease. A request for maintenance or repair by anyone residing in your apartment constitutes a request from all residents. The time, manner, method and means of performing maintenance and repairs, including whether or which vendors to use, are within our sole discretion. 15.2. Your Requirement to Notify. You must promptly notify us in writing of air conditioning or heating problems, water leaks or moisture, mold, electrical problems, malfunctioning lights, broken or missing locks or latches, or any other condition that poses a hazard or threat to property, health, or safety. Unless we instruct otherwise, you are required to keep the apartment cooled or heated according to this Lease. Air conditioning problems are normally not emergencies. 15.3. Utilities. We may change or install utility lines or equipment serving the apartment if the work is done reasonably without substantially increasing your utility costs. We may turn off equipment and interrupt utilities as needed to perform work or to avoid property damage or other emergencies. If utilities malfunction or are damaged by fire, water, or similar cause, you must notify our representative immediately. 15.4. Your Remedies. We’ll act with customary diligence to make repairs and reconnections within a reasonable time, taking into consideration when casualty-insurance proceeds are received. Unless required by statute after a casualty loss, or during equipment repair, your Rent will not abate in whole or in part. “Reasonable time” accounts for the severity and nature of the problem and the reasonable availability of materials, labor, and utilities. If we fail to timely repair a condition that materially affects the physical health or safety of an ordinary resident as required by the Texas Property Code, you may be entitled to exercise remedies under § 92.056 and § 92.0561 of the Texas Property Code. If you follow the procedures under those sections, the following remedies, among others, may be available to you: (1) termination of this Lease and an appropriate refund under 92.056(f); (2) have the condition repaired or remedied according to § 92.0561; (3) deduct from the Rent the cost of the repair or remedy according to § 92.0561; and 4) judicial remedies according to § 92.0563. 16. Our Right to Terminate for Apartment Community Damage or Closure. If, in our sole judgment, damages to the unit or building are significant or performance of needed repairs poses a danger to you, we may terminate this Lease and your right to possession by giving you at least 7 days’ written notice. If termination occurs, you agree we’ll refund only prorated rent and all deposits, minus lawful deduc- tions. We may remove and dispose of your personal property if, in our sole judgment, it causes a health or safety hazard or impedes our ability to make repairs. 16.1. Property Closure. We also have the right to terminate this Lease and your right to possession by giving you at least 30 days’ written notice of termination if we are demolishing your apartment or closing it and it will no longer be used for residential purposes for at least 6 months, or if any part of the property becomes subject to an eminent domain proceeding. 17. Assignments and Subletting. You may not assign this Lease or sub- let your apartment. You agree that you won‘t rent, offer to rent or license all or any part of your apartment to anyone else unless other- wise agreed to in advance by us in writing. You agree that you won‘t accept anything of value from anyone else for the use of any part of your apartment. You agree not to list any part of your apartment on any lodging or short-term rental website or with any person or ser- vice that advertises dwellings for rent. 18. Security and Safety Devices. We’ll pay for missing security de- vices that are required by law. You’ll pay for: (A) rekeying that you request (unless we failed to rekey after the previous resi- dent moved out); and (B) repairs or replacements because of misuse or damage by you or your family, your occupants, or your guests. You must pay immediately after the work is done unless state law authorizes advance payment. You must also pay in advance for any additional or changed security devices you request. Texas Property Code secs. 92.151, 92.153, and 92.154 require, with some exceptions, that we provide at no cost to you when occupancy begins: (A) a window latch on each window; (B) a doorviewer (peep- hole or window) on each exterior door; (C) a pin lock on each sliding door; (D) either a door-handle latch or a security bar on each sliding door; (E) a keyless bolting device (deadbolt) on each exterior door; and (F) either a keyed doorknob lock or a keyed deadbolt lock on one entry door. Keyed locks will be rekeyed after the prior resident moves out. The rekeying will be done either before you move in or within 7 days after you move in, as required by law. If we fail to in- stall or rekey security devices as required by law, you have the right to do so and deduct the reasonable cost from your next Rent pay- ment under Texas Property Code sec. 92.165(1). We may deactivate or not install keyless bolting devices on your doors if (A) you or an occupant in the dwelling is over 55 or disabled, and (B) the require- ments of Texas Property Code sec. 92.153(e) or (f) are satisfied. 18.1. Smoke Alarms and Detection Devices. We’ll furnish smoke alarms or other detection devices required by law or city ordinance. We may install additional detectors not so required. We’ll test them and provide working batteries when you first take possession of your apartment. Upon request, we’ll provide, as required by law, a smoke alarm capable of alerting a person with a hearing impairment. You must pay for and replace batteries as needed, unless the law provides otherwise. We may replace dead or missing batteries at your expense, without prior notice to you. Neither you nor your guests or occupants may disable alarms or detectors. If you damage or disable the smoke alarm or remove a battery without replacing it with a working battery, you may be liable to us under Texas Property Code sec. 92.2611 for $100 plus one month’s Rent, actual damages, and attorney’s fees. 18.2. Duty to Report. You must immediately report to us any missing, malfunctioning or defective security devices, smoke alarms or detectors. You’ll be liable if you fail to report malfunctions, or fail to report any loss, damage, or fines resulting from fire, smoke, or water. 19. Resident Safety and Loss. Unless otherwise required by law, none of us, our employees, agents, or management companies are liable to you, your guests or occupants for any damage, personal injury, loss to personal property, or loss of business or personal income, from any cause, including but not limited to: negligent or intention- al acts of residents, occupants, or guests; theft, burglary, assault, vandalism or other crimes; fire, flood, water leaks, rain, hail, ice, snow, smoke, lightning, wind, explosions, interruption of utilities, pipe leaks or other occurrences unless such damage, injury or loss is caused exclusively by our negligence. We do not warrant security of any kind. You agree that you will not rely upon any security measures taken by us for personal security, and that you will call 911 and local law enforcement authorities if any security needs arise. You acknowledge that we are not equipped or trained to provide personal security services to you, your guests or occupants. You rec- ognize that we are not required to provide any private security ser- vices and that no security devices or measures on the property are fail-safe. You further acknowledge that, even if an alarm or gate ame- nities are provided, they are mechanical devices that can malfunc- tion. Any charges resulting from the use of an intrusion alarm will be charged to you, including, but not limited to, any false alarms with police/fire/ambulance response or other required city charges. 20. Condition of the Premises and Alterations. 20.1. As-Is. We disclaim all implied warranties. You accept the apartment, fixtures, and furniture as is, except for conditions materially affecting the health or safety of ordinary persons. You’ll be given an Inventory and Condition Form at or before move-in. You agree that after completion of the form or within 48 hours after move-in, whichever comes first, you must note on the form all defects or damage, sign the form, return it to us, and the form accurately reflects the condition of the premises for purposes of determining any refund due to you when you move out. Otherwise, everything will be considered to be in a clean, safe, and good working condition. You must still send a separate request for any repairs needed as provided by Par. 15.1. 20.2. Standards and Improvements. Unless authorized by law or by us in writing, you must not perform any repairs, painting, wallpapering, carpeting, electrical changes, or otherwise alter our property.

Page 5 of 6 bells, or lock changes, additions, or rekeying is permitted unless required by law or we’ve consented in writing. You may install a satellite dish or antenna, but only if you sign our satellite dish or antenna lease addendum, which complies with reasonable restrictions allowed by federal law. You must not alter, damage, or remove our property, including alarm systems, detection devices, appliances, furniture, telephone and television wiring, screens, locks, or security devices. When you move in, we’ll supply light bulbs for fixtures we furnish, in- cluding exterior fixtures operated from inside the apartment; after that, you’ll replace them at your expense with bulbs of the same type and wattage. Your improvements to the apartment (made with or without our consent) become ours unless we agree otherwise in writing. 21. Notices. Written notice to or from our employees, agents, or management companies constitutes notice to or from us. Notices to you or any other resident of the apartment constitute notice to all residents. Notices and requests from any resident constitute notice from all residents. Only residents can give notice of Lease termination and intent to move out under Par. 7.3. All notices and documents will be in English and, at our option, in any other language that you read or speak. 21.1. Electronic Notice. Notice may be given electronically by us to you if allowed by law. If allowed by law and in accordance with this Lease, electronic notice from you to us must be sent to the email address and/or portal specified in this Lease. Notice may also be given by phone call or to a physical address if allowed in this Lease. You represent that you have provided your current email address to us, and that you will notify us in the event your email address changes. EVICTION AND REMEDIES 22. Liability. Each resident is jointly and severally liable for all Lease obligations. If you or any guest or occupant violates this Lease or our Community Policies, all residents are considered to have violated this Lease. 22.1. Indemnification by You. You’ll defend, indemnify and hold us and our employees, agents, and management company harmless from all liability arising from your conduct or requests to our representatives and from the conduct of or requests by your invitees, occupants or guests. 23. Default by Resident. 23.1. Acts of Default. You’ll be in default if: (A) you don’t timely pay Rent, including monthly recurring charges, or other amounts you owe; (B) you or any guest or occupant violates this Lease, our Community Policies, or fire, safety, health, criminal or other laws, regardless of whether or where arrest or conviction occurs; (C) you give incorrect, incomplete, or false answers in a rental application or in this Lease; or (D) you or any occupant is charged, detained, convicted, or given deferred adjudication or pretrial diversion for (1) an offense involving actual or potential physical harm to a person, or involving the manufacture or delivery of a controlled substance, marijuana, or drug paraphernalia as defined in the Texas Controlled Substances Act, or (2) any sex- related crime, including a misdemeanor. 23.2. Eviction. If you default, including holding over, we may end your right of occupancy by giving you at least a 24- hour written notice to vacate. Termination of your possession rights doesn’t release you from liability for future Rent or other Lease obligations. After giving notice to vacate or filing an eviction suit, we may still accept Rent or other sums due; the filing or acceptance doesn’t waive or diminish our right of eviction or any other contractual or statutory right. Accepting money at any time doesn’t waive our right to damages, to past or future Rent or other sums, or to our continuing with eviction proceedings. In an eviction, Rent is owed for the full rental period and will not be prorated. 23.3. Acceleration. Unless we elect not to accelerate Rent, all monthly Rent for the rest of the Lease term or renewal period will be accelerated automatically without notice or demand (before or after acceleration) and will be immediately due if, without our written consent: (A) you move out, remove property in preparing to move out, or you or any occupant gives oral or written notice of intent to move out before the Lease term or renewal period ends; and (B) you haven’t paid all Rent for the entire Lease term or renewal period. Remaining Rent will also be accelerated if you’re judicially evicted or move out when we demand because you’ve defaulted. If you don’t pay the first month’s Rent when or before this Lease begins, all future Rent for the Lease term will be automatically accelerated without notice and become immediately due. We also may end your right of occupancy and recover damages, future Rent, attorney’s fees, court costs, and other lawful charges. 23.4. Holdover. You and all occupants must vacate and surrender the apartment by or before the date contained in: (1) your move-out notice (2) our notice to vacate, (3) our notice of non-renewal, or (4) a written agreement specifying a different move-out date. If a holdover occurs, then you’ll be liable to us for all Rent for the full term of the previously signed lease of a new resident who can’t occupy because of the holdover, and at our option, we may extend the Lease term and/or increase the Rent by 25% by delivering written notice to you or your apartment while you continue to hold over. 23.5. Other Remedies. We may report unpaid amounts to credit agencies as allowed by law. If we or our debt collector tries to collect any money you owe us, you agree that we or the debt collector may contact you by any legal means. If you default, you will pay us, in addition to other sums due, any rental discounts or concessions agreed to in writing that have been applied to your account. We may recover attorney’s fees in connection with enforcing our rights under this Lease. All unpaid amounts you owe bear interest at the rate provided by Texas Finance Code Section 304.003(c) from the due date. You must pay all collection- agency fees if you fail to pay sums due within 10 days after you are mailed a letter demanding payment and stating that collection-agency fees will be added if you don’t pay all sums by that deadline. You are also liable for a charge (not to exceed $150) to cover our time, cost and expense for any eviction proceeding against you, plus our attorney’s fees and expenses, court costs, and filing fees actually paid. 24. Representatives’ Authority and Waivers. Our representatives (in- cluding management personnel, employees, and agents) have no authority to waive, amend, or terminate this Lease or any part of it unless in writing and signed, and no authority to make promises, rep- resentations, or agreements that impose security duties or other ob- ligations on us or our representatives, unless in writing and signed. No action or omission by us will be considered a waiver of our rights or of any subsequent violation, default, or time or place of performance. Our choice to enforce, not enforce or delay enforcement of written-no- tice requirements, rental due dates, acceleration, liens, or any other rights isn’t a waiver under any circumstances. Delay in demanding sums you owe is not a waiver. Except when notice or demand is required by law, you waive any notice and demand for performance from us if you default. Nothing in this Lease constitutes a waiver of our remedies for a breach under your prior lease that occurred before the Lease term begins. Your Lease is subordinate to existing and future recorded mortgages, un- less the owner’s lender chooses otherwise. All remedies are cumulative. Exercising one remedy won’t constitute an election or waiver of other remedies. All provisions regarding our nonliability or nonduty apply to our employees, agents, and manage- ment companies. No employee, agent, or management company is personally liable for any of our contractual, statutory, or other obliga- tions merely by virtue of acting on our behalf. END OF THE LEASE TERM 25. Move-Out Notice. Before moving out, you must give our represen- tative advance written move-out notice as stated in Par. 4, even if this Lease has become a month-to-month lease. The move-out date can’t be changed unless we and you both agree in writing. Your move-out notice must comply with each of the following: (a) Unless we require more than 30 days’ notice, if you give notice on the first day of the month you intend to move out, move out will be on the last day of that month. (b) Your move-out notice must not terminate this Lease before the end of the Lease term or renewal period. (c) If we require you to give us more than 30 days’ written notice to move out before the end of the Lease term, we will give you 1 written reminder not less than 5 days nor more than 90 days before your deadline for giving us your written move-out notice. If we fail to give a reminder notice, 30 days’ written notice to move out is required. (d) You must get from us a written acknowledgment of your notice. 26. Move-Out Procedures. 26. 1. Cleaning. You must thoroughly clean the apartment, including doors, windows, furniture, bathrooms, kitchen appliances, patios, balconies, garages, carports, and storage rooms. You must follow move-out cleaning instructions if they have been provided. If you don’t clean adequately, you’ll be liable for reasonable cleaning charges—including charges for cleaning carpets, draperies, furniture, walls, etc. that are soiled beyond Apartment Lease Contract, TAA Official Statewide Form 23-A/B-1/B-2 Revised October 2023 Page 6 of 6 normal wear (that is, wear or soiling that occurs without negligence, carelessness, accident, or abuse). 26.2. Move-Out Inspection. We may, but are not obligated to, provide a joint move-out inspection. Our representatives have no authority to bind or limit us regarding deductions for repairs, damages, or charges. Any statements or estimates by us or our representative are subject to our correction, modi- fication, or disapproval before final accounting or refunding. 27. Surrender and Abandonment. You have surrendered the apartment when: (A) the move-out date has passed and no one is living in the apartment in our reasonable judgment; or (B) apartment keys and ac- cess devices listed in Par. 2.1 have been turned in to us—whichever happens first. You have abandoned the apartment when all of the following have occurred: (A) everyone appears to have moved out in our reasonable judgment; (B) you’ve been in default for nonpayment of Rent for 5 consecutive days, or water, gas, or electric service for the apartment not connected in our name has been terminated or transferred; and (C) you’ve not responded for 2 days to our notice left on the inside of the main entry door stating that we consider the apartment aban- doned. An apartment is also considered abandoned 10 days after the death of a sole resident. 27.1. The Ending of Your Rights. Surrender, abandonment, or judicial eviction ends your right of possession for all purposes and gives us the immediate right to clean up, make repairs in, and relet the apartment; determine any security-deposit deductions; and remove or store property left in the apartment. 27.2. Removal and Storage of Property. We, or law officers, may— but have no duty to—remove or store all property that in our sole judgment belongs to you and remains in the apartment or in common areas (including any vehicles you or any occupant or guest owns or uses) after you’re judicially evicted or if you surrender or abandon the apartment. We’re not liable for casualty, loss, damage, or theft. You must pay reasonable charges for our packing, removing and storing any property. Except for animals, we may throw away or give to a charitable organization all personal property that is: (1) left in the apartment after surrender or abandonment; or (2) left outside more than 1 hour after writ of possession is executed, following judicial eviction. An animal removed after surrender, abandonment, or eviction may be kenneled or turned over to a local authority, humane society, or rescue organization. GENERAL PROVISIONS AND SIGNATURES 28.

If not, the following applies: (A) this Lease is voidable at your option and is unenforceable by us (except for property damages); and (B) we may not recover past or future rent or other charges.

You must not let an animal—other than an assistance or service animal—into swimming­pool areas, laun­ dry rooms, offices, clubrooms, other recreational facilities, or other dwelling units besides your own, except that search and rescue dogs shall be allowed to use areas of the property ac­ cessible to the general public, such as the leasing office. Cer­ tain service animals in training shall also be allowed to use those areas when accompanied by an approved trainer. 13.8 Food & Water. Your animal must be fed and given water in­ side the dwelling unit. You may not leave animal food or water outside the dwelling unit at any time, except in fenced yards (if any) for your exclusive use. 13.9 Leash. You must keep the animal on a leash and under your su­ pervision when outside the dwelling or in any private fenced area. We or our representative may pick up unleashed animals, report them to the proper authorities, or do both. We’ll charge you a rea­ sonable fee for picking up and keeping unleashed animals. 13.10 Animal Waste. Unless we have designated a particular area in your dwelling unit or on the grounds for animal defecation and urination, you are prohibited from letting an animal defecate or urinate anywhere on our property and you must take the ani­ mal off our property for that purpose. If we allow animal defeca­ tion inside the unit, you must ensure that it’s done in a litter box with a kitty­litter­type mix. If the animal defecates anywhere on our property (including in a fenced yard for your exclusive use), you must immediately remove the waste and repair any damage. In addition to the terms of this addendum, you must comply with all local ordinances regarding animal defecation. 14. Additional Rules. We may make reasonable changes to the animal rules from time to time if we distribute a written copy of any changes to every resident who is allowed to have animals. 15. Violation of Rules. If you, your guest, or any occupant violates any rule or provision of this addendum (in our judgment) and we give you written notice of the violation, you must remove the animal immedi­ ately and permanently from the premises. We also have all other rights and remedies set forth in the Lease, including eviction and recovering damages and attorney’s fees from you. 16. Complaints About Animal. If we receive a reasonable complaint from a neighbor or other resident or if we, in our sole discretion, determine that the animal has disturbed neighbors or other residents, we will give you written notice and you must immediately and permanently remove the animal from the premises. 17. Our Removal of an Animal. In some circumstances, we may enter the dwelling unit and remove the animal within one day after leaving a written notice in a conspicuous place. 17.1 Causes for Removal. We can remove an animal under this para­ graph if, in our sole judgment, you have: (A) abandoned the animal; (B) left the animal in the dwelling unit for an extended period of time without food or water; (C) failed to care for a sick animal; (D) violated our animal rules; OR (E) let the animal defecate or urinate where it’s not allowed. 17.2 Removal Process. To remove an animal, we must follow the procedures in the Lease, and we may turn the animal over to a humane society or local authority. We’ll return the animal to you upon request if we haven’t already turned it over to a humane society or local authority. We don’t have a lien on the animal for any purpose, but you must pay for reasonable care and ken­ neling charges for the animal. If you don’t pick up the animal within five days after we remove it, it will be considered aban­ doned. 18. Liability for Damage, Injuries, Cleaning. Except for reasonable wear and tear resulting from an assistance or service animal, you and all co­ residents are jointly and severally liable for the entire amount of any damage the animal causes, including cleaning, defleaing, or deodor­ izing. This provision applies to all parts of the dwelling unit including carpets, doors, walls, drapes, wall paper, windows, screens, furniture, and appliances, as well as landscaping and other outside improvements. If an `item cannot be satisfactorily cleaned or repaired, you must pay for us to replace it. Payment for damage, repairs, cleaning, replacements, and the like are due immediately upon demand. As the owner, you’re strictly liable for the entire amount of any injury that your animal causes to an­ other person or to anyone’s property. You indemnify us for all costs of litigation and attorney’s fees resulting from any such injury or damage. 19. Move-Out. Except for reasonable wear and tear resulting from an as­ sistance or service animal, when you move out, you’ll pay for deflea­ ing, deodorizing, and shampooing to protect future residents from possible health hazards, regardless of how long the animal was there. We—not you—will arrange for these services. 20. Multiple Residents. Each resident who signed the Lease must also sign this addendum. You, your guests, and any occupants must follow all animal rules. Each resident is jointly and severally liable for dam­ ages and all other obligations set forth in this addendum, even if the resident does not own the animal. 21. Dog Park. We may provide an area to be used as a dog park. While using the park, you will be required to supervise your dog, but may remove the leash. Leashes must be used while traveling to and from the park. The park is not supervised or monitored in any way, and you use the park at your own risk. We are not liable for any injury, damage or loss which is caused as a result of any problem, defect or malfunc­ tion of the park. We are also not liable for injury, damage or loss to any person, animal or property caused by any other person or animal, including, but not limited to, dog bite, trespass, assault or any other crime. Furthermore, we are not liable for any disruption in the park’s operation or performance.

This Animal Addendum and the animal rules are consid­ ered part of the Lease described above. 23. Animal Restrictions. No animal will be allowed that poses a threat to any other person. You represent that your animal(s) does not pose a danger or threat of any kind to any person or property; has not dis­ played vicious, aggressive or dangerous behavior; and has never be­ fore injured you or any other person or animal or caused any dam­ age to your property or another person’s property. You affirmatively represent and warrant that you have never had a claim or lawsuit filed against you or anyone else for an injury or damage caused by or re­ lated to the animal. You understand and agree that the approval of the animal to live in your apartment is expressly conditioned upon all of the forgoing being true and if you have made any misrepresentation it is a violation of the Lease. You are entitled to receive a copy of this Addendum after it is fully signed. Keep it in a safe place.

Purpose. This addendum modifies the Lease Contract to address any infestation of bed bugs (Cimex lectularius) that might be found in the dwelling or on your personal property.

Access for Inspection and Pest Treatment. You must allow us and our pest-control agents access to the dwelling at reasonable times to inspect for or treat bed bugs. We can also inspect and treat adjacent or neighboring dwellings to the infestation, even if those dwellings are not the source or cause of the known infestation. Si- multaneously as we treat the dwelling, you must, at your expense, have your personal property, furniture, clothing, and possessions treated according to accepted treatment methods by a licensed pest-control firm that we approve. You agree not to treat the dwell- ing for a bed-bug infestation on your own. 5. Notification. You must promptly notify us: • of any known or suspected bed-bug infestation or presence in the dwelling, or in any of your clothing, furniture, or per- sonal property; • of any recurring or unexplained bites, stings, irritations, or sores on the skin or body that you believe are caused by bed bugs, or by any condition or pest you believe is in the dwell- ing; AND • if you discover any condition or evidence that might indicate the presence or infestation of bed bugs, or if you receive any confirmation of bed-bug presence by a licensed pest-control professional or other authoritative source. 6. Cooperation. If we confirm the presence or infestation of bed bugs, you must cooperate and coordinate with us and our pest-control agents to treat and eliminate them.

You may be required to pay all reasonable costs of cleaning and pest-control treatments incurred by us to treat your dwelling unit for bed bugs. If we confirm the presence or infestation of bed bugs after you move out, you may be responsible for the cost of cleaning and pest control. If we have to move other residents in order to treat adjoining or neighboring dwellings to your dwelling unit, you may have to pay any lost rental income and other expens- es we incur to relocate the neighboring residents and to clean and perform pest-control treatments to eradicate infestations in other dwellings. If you don’t pay us for any costs you are liable for, you will be in default and we will have the right to terminate your right of occupancy and exercise all rights and remedies under the Lease, and we may take immediate possession of the dwelling. If you don’t move out after your right of occupancy has been terminated, you will be liable for holdover rent under the Lease. 8. Transfers.

You acknowledge that the property, including its common areas and apartments, may currently or in the future, be under repair, renovation, improvement, or construction. We do not guarantee that the repair, renovation, improvement, or construction will be completed on a set date or time and therefore, are not under any obligation to have said repair, renovation, improvement, or construction completed by a set date or time. You also acknowledge that the repair, renovation, improvement, or construction does not represent a breach of our obligations under the Lease Contract. 4. Use of Amenities and Services. Repair, renovation, improvement, or construction at the property may create conditions where your use of the property’s amenities and services may be limited or not available. You agree to observe and follow any signage regarding construction placed on the property by us or our contractors. Various dangers that may be present include potentially harmful chemicals, construction machinery, construction tools, nails, screws, falling debris, and other items that are typically found at construction sites. No sign or form can contemplate or discuss every possible construction issue that could arise on a property, so you acknowledge and agree that you will use your best judgment and common sense to avoid injuring yourself, your animals, or others as you enter or leave the property. 5. Noise and Other Disturbances. Repair, renovation, improvement, or construction at or near the property may create noise or other disturbances, and the property itself, or portions thereof, may be unfinished for some time with respect to landscaping, building exteriors, interiors, amenities, walkways, lighting and the like. You acknowledge that these conditions may create inconveniences that may be beyond our control. You agree that despite these inconveniences, your obligations set forth in the Lease, including payment of rent, will still be in effect. 6. No Offset of Rent. To the extent allowed by state law or local ordinance, you agree that any inconvenience associated with the repair, renovation, improvement, or construction, such as, but not limited to, those disclosed herein, will not be deemed to offset your rent obligations. 7. Delay of Occupancy. You acknowledge that occupancy of the apartment may be delayed due to repair, renovation, improvement, or construction of the property, including common areas and apartments. Such repair, renovation, improvement, or construction may cause unforeseen delays due to scheduling conflicts, delay in permit issuance, acts of God, and other things beyond our control. The Lease will remain in effect subject to: (1) the start date of the term of the lease contract shall be changed to the first day that we provide you the apartment for occupancy, and rent shall be abated until occupancy is provided; and (2) your right to terminate as set forth in your Lease under DELAY OF OCCUPANCY, and in accordance with applicable state law or local ordinance. You knowingly and voluntarily accept the risks of delays and the apartment not being ready for occupancy on the date set forth in the Lease. You agree that our failure to have the apartment ready on the set date in the Lease due to a repair, renovation, improvement, or construction delay does not constitute a willful failure to deliver possession of the apartment or entitle you to any other form of credit, discount or other compensation. We agree that rent will not commence under the Lease until possession is delivered to you. 8. Displacement. In the event Resident must be displaced from the apartment that is the subject of the Lease Contract due to repair, renovation, improvement, or construction in or around the apartment, Owner, at Owner’s sole option, shall transfer Resident to another apartment within the apartment community that is not affected by the repair, renovation, improvement, or construction or shall provide appropriate comparable accommodations for Resident. However, in the event of Resident’s displacement and subsequent re-location, the terms of the Lease Contract, including but not limited to the payment of rent, shall remain in full force and effect. 9. Severability. If any provision of this Lease Contract is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability only without invalidating or otherwise affecting the remainder of this Lease Contract. The court shall interpret the lease contract and provisions herein in a manner such as to uphold the valid portions of this Lease Contract while preserving the intent of the parties. 10. Release and Waiver of Claims. Neither we nor any of our agents, employees, management company, its agents, or its employees shall be liable for any damage or injury to you, your invitees, your licensees, your occupants, or your guests that results from any condition related to the construction that is occurring on the property. This release is of and from any and all claims, controversies, disputes, actions, demands, causes of action, or liability of every kind and description, known or unknown, at law or in equity, which you or they had in the past, now have, or may hereafter have in the future against us or our management company or either of their agents or employees arising out of or in any way connected, directly or indirectly, with the construction that is occurring on the property. 11.

Each additional card for you or your occupants will require a $ non-refundable fee. q Code for gate access. Each resident will be given, at no cost, an access code (keypad number) for the pedestrian or vehicular access gates. It is to be used only during your residency. 3. Damaged, lost or unreturned remote controls, cards, key fobs or code changes. q If a remote control is lost, stolen or damaged, a $ fee will be charged for a replacement. If a remote control is not returned or is returned damaged when you move out, there will be a $ deduction from the security deposit. q If a card is lost, stolen or damaged, a $ fee will be charged for a replacement card. If a card is not returned or is returned damaged when you move out, there will be a $ deduction from the security deposit. q We may change the code(s) at any time and notify you accordingly. 4. Report damage or malfunctions. Please immediately report to the office any malfunction or damage to gates, fencing, locks, or related equipment. 5. Follow written instructions. You and all other occupants must read and follow the written instructions that have been furnished to you regarding the access gates.

Personal injury and/or personal property damage. Anything mechanical or electronic is subject to malfunction. Fencing, gates, or other devices will not prevent all crime. No security system or device is foolproof or 100 percent successful in deterring crime. Crime can still occur. Protecting residents, their families, occupants, guests, and invitees from crime is the sole responsibility of residents, occupants, and law enforcement agencies. You should first call 911 or other appropriate emergency police numbers if a crime occurs or is suspected. We are not liable to any resident, guest, occupant, or invitee for personal injury, death, or damage/loss of personal property from incidents related to perimeter fencing, automobile access gates, and/or pedestrian access gates. We reserve the right to modify or eliminate security systems other than those statutorily required. 7. RULES IN USING VEHICLE GATES. • Always approach entry and exit gates with caution and at a very slow rate of speed. • Never stop your car where the gate can hit your vehicle as the gate opens or closes. • Never follow another vehicle into an open gate. Always use your card to gain entry. • Report to management the vehicle license plate number of any vehicle that piggybacks through the gate. • Never force the gate open with your car. • Never get out of your vehicle while the gates are opening or closing. • If you are using the gates with a boat or trailer, please contact management for assistance. The length and width of the trailer may cause recognition problems with the safety loop detector and could cause damage. • Do not operate the gate if there are small children nearby who might get caught in it as it opens or closes. • If you lose your card, please contact the management office immediately. • Do not give your card or code to anyone else. • Do not tamper with gate or allow your occupants to tamper or play with gates. \b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b Signatures of All Residents \b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b \b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b \b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b \b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b \b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b \b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b Signature of Owner or Owner’s Representative Texas Apartment Association X X 3111 Lakeline Crossing Cedar Park 40.00 25.00 40.00 40.00 25.00 25.00 Joshua Skidds Erin Skidds Texas Apartment Association LEASE ADDENDUM FOR ALLOCATING TRASH REMOVAL AND RECYCLING COSTS 1. Addendum. This is an addendum to the TAA Lease Contract for Apt. No. in the Apartments in , Texas OR the house, duplex, etc. located at (street address) in , Texas. 2. Reason for allocation. Our property receives a single bill for trash removal/recycling. In recent years, many trash haulers and recyclers have increased fees dramatically to keep pace with rising costs associated with landfills and environmental mandates. By allocating this bill, we hope to make residents more aware of the true costs of waste disposal and to help reduce, reuse and recycle, and in turn, lower both costs and the impact on our environment. 3. Your payment due date. Payment of your allocated trash removal and recycling bill is due 16 days after the date it is postmarked or hand delivered to your apartment. You agree to mail or deliver payment to the place indicated on your bill so that payment is received no later than the due date. There will be a late charge of $ (not to exceed $3) if we do not receive timely payment. If you are late in paying the trash removal/recycling bill, we may immediately exercise all lawful remedies under your lease contract, including eviction—just like late payment of rent. 4. Allocation procedures. Your monthly base rent under the TAA Lease Contract does not include a charge for trash removal/recycling. You will pay separately for these monthly recurring fixed charges which are defined under the Lease as “Additional Rent”. You may receive a separate bill from us each month or we may include these items as separate and distinct charges as part of a multi-item bill. You agree to and we will allocate the monthly trash removal/recycling bill for the apartment community based on the allocation method checked below. (check only one) q A percentage reflecting your apartment unit’s share of the total square footage in the apartment community, i.e., your unit’s square footage divided by the total square footage in all apartment units. q A percentage reflecting your apartment unit’s share of the total number of people living in the apartment community, i.e., the number of people living in your apartment divided by the total number of people living in the entire apartment community for the month. (“People” for this purpose are all residents and occupants listed in leases at the apartment community as having a right to occupy the respective units.) q Half of your allocation will be based on your apartment unit’s share of total square footage and half will be based on your share of total people living in the apartment community, as described above. q Per dwelling unit q Other formula (see attached page) 5. Penalties and fees. Only the total trash removal/recycling bill will be allocated. Penalties or interest for any late payment of the master trash removal/ recycling bill by us will be paid for by us and will not be allocated. A nominal administrative fee of $ per month (not to exceed $3) will be added to your bill for processing, billing and collecting. Your trash removal/recycling allocation bill may include state and local sales taxes as required by state law. 6. Change of allocation formula. The above allocation formula for determining your share of the trash removal/recycling costs cannot be changed except as follows: (1) you receive notice of the new formula at least 35 days before it takes effect; and (2) you agree to the change in a signed lease renewal or signed mutual agreement. 7. Right to examine records. You may examine the trash removal/recycling bill we receive from the trash utility and our calculations related to the monthly allocation of the trash recycling/removal bill during regular weekday office hours. Please give us reasonable advance notice to gather the data. \b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b Signatures of All Residents \b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b \b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b \b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b \b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b \b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b \b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b Signature of Owner or Owner’s Representative X Cedar Park 0.00 3111 Lakeline Crossing Joshua Skidds Erin Skidds Texas Apartment Association LEASE ADDENDUM FOR ALLOCATING SERVICES AND GOVERNMENTAL FEES 1. Addendum. This is an addendum to the TAA Lease Contract for Apt. No. in the Apartments in , Texas. The terms of this addendum will control if the terms of the Lease and this addendum conflict. 2. Reason for allocation. Apartment owners receive bills for services provided to residents and charges for various governmental fees. These are direct costs that the apartment community incurs. In order to help control the cost of rent, we have chosen to allocate the services and governmental fees indicated below through an allocated bill using a standardized formula to distribute these costs fairly. While we may impose a nominal fee to help recover our costs in administering these bills, we do not add any other costs to these bills and make no profit off of them. 3.

Mold Information and Prevention Addendum Please note: We want to maintain a high-quality living environment for our residents. To help achieve this goal, it is important that we work together to minimize any mold growth in your dwelling. This Addendum contains important information for you, and responsibilities for both you and us. 1. Addendum. This is an addendum between the Residents and Owner as described in the Lease for the dwelling described below: Unit # _________________________________________________ at _____________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________ (name of apartments) or other dwelling located at _______________________________ _______________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________ (street address of house, duplex, etc.) City/State/Zip where dwelling is located: _____________________ _______________________________________________________ 2. About Mold. Mold is found everywhere in our environment, both indoors and outdoors and in both new and old structures. To avoid mold growth, it’s important to prevent excess moisture buildup in your dwelling. Promptly notify us in writing about any air-condi- tioning or heating-system problems and any signs of water leaks, water infiltration or mold. We will respond in accordance with state law and the Lease to repair or remedy the situation. If small areas of mold have already accumulated on nonporous surfaces (such as ceramic tile, formica, vinyl flooring, metal, wood, or plastic), the Environmental Protection Agency recommends that you first clean the areas with soap (or detergent) and water and let the surface dry thoroughly. When the surface is dry—and within 24 hours of cleaning—apply a premixed spray-on household biocide. Do not clean or apply biocides to visible mold on porous sur- faces such as sheetrock walls or ceilings or to large areas of visible mold on nonporous surfaces. Instead, notify us in writing and we will take appropriate action to comply with Section 92.051 et seq. of the Texas Property Code, subject to the special exceptions for natu- ral disasters. If you fail to comply with this addendum, you can be held respon- sible for property damage to the dwelling and any health problems that may result. You are entitled to receive a copy of this Addendum after it is fully signed. Keep it in a safe place.

For the duration of the Lease, Lessee is required to maintain and provide the following minimum required insurance coverage: • $100,000 Limit of Liability for Lessee’s legal liability for damage to Lessor’s property for no less than the following causes of loss: fire, smoke, explosion, backup or overflow of sewer, drain or sump, and water damage (“Required Insurance”). Lessee is required to furnish Lessor with evidence of Required Insurance prior to occupancy of leased premises and at the time of each lease renewal period. If at any time Lessee does not have Required Insurance, Lessee is in breach of the Lease and Lessor shall have, in addition to any other rights under the Lease, the right but not the obligation to purchase Required Insurance coverage protecting the sole interest of the Lessor and seek contractual reimbursement from the Lessee for all costs and expenses associated with such purchase. This may be referred to as “force placed insurance”. Lessee may obtain Required Insurance or broader coverage from an insurance agent or insurance company of Lessee’s choice. If Lessee furnishes evidence of such insurance and maintains the insurance for the duration of the Lease, then nothing more is required. If Lessee does not maintain Required Insurance, the insurance requirement of this Lease may be satisfied by Lessor, who may purchase such coverage through the Lessor’s Legal Liability Insurance Policy (“LLIP”). The coverage provided under the LLIP will provide the Required Insurance coverage listed above. An amount equal to the total cost to the Lessor for the LLIP coverage shall be charged to Lessee by the Lessor as a recoverable expense under the Lease. Some important points of this coverage, which Lessee should understand are: 1. LLIP is designed to fulfill the insurance requirement of the Lease. Lessor is the Insured under the LLIP. This is single interest forced placed insurance. Lessee is not an Insured, Additional Insured or beneficiary under the LLIP. All loss payments are made to the Lessor. 2. LLIP coverage is NOT personal liability insurance or renters insurance. LLIP does not cover the Lessee’s personal property (contents), additional living expenses or liability arising out of bodily injury or property damage to any third party. If Lessee requires any of these coverages, then Lessee should contact an insurance agent or insurance company of Lessee’s choice to obtain personal liability insurance or renters insurance to protect Lessee’s interests. 3. Coverage under the LLIP may be more expensive than the cost of Required Insurance obtainable by Lessee elsewhere. At any time, Lessee may contact an insurance agent or insurance company of their choice for insurance options to satisfy the Required Insurance under this Lease. 4. If Lessee has purchased Renters Insurance and at any time allows such Renters Insurance to lapse in breach of the Lease Agreement, Lessor may purchase Lessor Insurance without notice and add the total cost associated therewith to Lessee’s monthly rent payment. 5. Licensed insurance agents may receive a commission on the LLIP. 6. The total cost to the Lessee for the Lessor obtaining LLIP shall be $____________ per month. This is an amount equal to the actual premium charge to the Lessor including any premium taxes and fees due to state governing bodies and also includes a $____________ administrative expense fee for the expense of processing monthly payments and administering this program. There are no other fees, costs or charges added to or included within this total cost. 7. In the event that loss or damage to Lessor’s property exceeds the amount of Required Insurance, Lessee shall remain contractually liable to Lessor for such amount. In the event of liability to any other party for bodily injury or property damage, Lessee shall remain liable to such other party. 8. It shall be the Lessee’s duty to notify Lessor of any subsequent purchase of Renters Insurance. As used in this Addendum: “Lease” may be interchangeable with “Lease Agreement”; “Lessee” may be interchangeable with “Resident” or “Tenant”, and “Lessor” may be interchangeable with “Landlord” or “Owner”. Scheduling of the premises under the LLIP is not mandatory and Lessee may purchase Required Insurance from an insurance agent or insurance company of Lessee’s choice at any time and coverage under the LLIP will be terminated by the Lessor. 14.00 4.00 __________________________________________ __________________________________ Lessee Signature Date __________________________________________ __________________________________ Lessee Signature Date __________________________________________ __________________________________ Lessee Signature Date __________________________________________ __________________________________ Lessee Signature Date Joshua Skidds 09/11/2024 Erin Skidds 09/11/2024 Texas Apartment Association LEASE ADDENDUM FOR SATELLITE DISH OR ANTENNA Under a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) order, you as our resident have a right to install a transmitting or receiving satellite dish or antenna on the leased premises, subject to FCC limitations. We as a rental housing owner are allowed to impose reasonable restrictions relating to such installation. You are required to comply with these restrictions as a condition of installing such equipment. This addendum contains the restrictions that you and we agree to follow. 1. Addendum. This is an addendum to the lease between you and us for Apt. No. in the Apartments in , Texas OR the house, duplex, etc. located at (street address) in , Texas. 2. Number and size. You may install satellite dish(es) or antenna(s) on the leased premises. A satellite dish may not exceed one meter (3.3 feet) in diameter. Antennas that only transmit signals or that are not covered by 47 CFR §1.4000 are prohibited. 3. Location. Your satellite dish or antenna must be located: (1) inside your dwelling; or (2) in an area outside your dwelling such as a balcony, patio, yard, etc. of which you have exclusive use under your lease. Installation is not permitted on any parking area, roof, exterior wall, window, window sill, fence, or common area, or in an area that other residents are allowed to use. A satellite dish or antenna may not protrude beyond the vertical and horizontal space that is leased to you for your exclusive use. 4. Safety and non-interference. Your installation: (1) must comply with all applicable ordinances and laws and all reasonable safety standards; (2) may not interfere with our cable, telephone or electrical systems or those of neighboring properties; (3) may not be connected to our telecommunication systems; and (4) may not be connected to our electrical system except by plugging into a 110-volt duplex receptacle. If the satellite dish or antenna is placed in a permitted outside area, it must be safely secured by one of three methods: (1) securely attaching it to a portable, heavy object such as a small slab of concrete; (2) clamping it to a part of the building’s exterior that lies within your leased premises (such as a balcony or patio railing); or (3) any other method approved by us in writing. No other methods are allowed. We may require reasonable screening of the satellite dish or antenna by plants, etc., so long as it does not impair reception. 5. Signal transmission from exterior dish or antenna to interior of dwelling. Under the FCC order, you may not damage or alter the leased premises and may not drill holes through outside walls, door jams, windowsills, etc. If your satellite dish or antenna is installed outside your dwelling (on a balcony, patio, etc.), the signals received by it may be transmitted to the interior of your dwelling only by the following methods: (1) running a “flat” cable under a door jam or windowsill in a manner that does not physically alter the premises and does not interfere with proper operation of the door or window; (2) running a traditional or flat cable through a pre-existing hole in the wall (that will not need to be enlarged to accommodate the cable); (3) connecting cables “through a window pane,” similar to how an external car antenna for a cellular phone can be connected to inside wiring by a device glued to either side of the window—without drilling a hole through the window; (4) wireless transmission of the signal from the satellite dish or antenna to a device inside the dwelling; or (5) any other method approved by us in writing. 6. Safety in installation. In order to assure safety, the strength and type of materials used for installation must be approved by us. Installation must be done by a qualified person or company approved by us. Our approval will not be unreasonably withheld. An installer provided by the seller of the satellite dish or antenna is presumed to be qualified. 7. Maintenance. You will have the sole responsibility for maintaining your satellite dish, antenna, and all related equipment. 8. Removal and damages. You must remove the satellite dish or antenna and all related equipment when you move out of the dwelling. In accordance with the TAA Lease Contract, you must pay for any damages and for the cost of repairs or repainting caused by negligence, carelessness, accident. or abuse which may be reasonably necessary to restore the leased premises to its condition prior to the installation of your satellite dish, antenna or related equipment. You will not be responsible for normal wear and tear. 9. Liability insurance and indemnity. You must take full responsibility for the satellite dish, antenna, and related equipment. If the dish or antenna is installed at a height or in some other way that could result in injury to others if it becomes unattached and falls, you must provide us with evidence of liability insurance to protect us against claims of personal injury and property damage to others, related to your satellite dish, antenna, and related equipment. The insurance coverage must be $ , which is an amount reasonably determined by us to accomplish that purpose. Factors affecting the amount of insurance include height of installation above ground level, potential wind velocities, risk of the dish/antenna becoming unattached and falling on someone, etc. You agree to hold us harmless and indemnify us against any of the above claims by others. 10. Security deposit. Your security deposit (in your Lease Contract) is increased by an additional reasonable sum of $ q effective at time of installation or q effective within days of installation to help protect us against possible repair costs, damages, or failure to remove the satellite dish, antenna and related equipment at time of move-out. Factors affecting any security deposit may vary, depending on: (1) how the dish or antenna is attached (nails, screws, lag bolts drilled into walls); (2) whether holes were permitted to be drilled through walls for the cable between the satellite dish and the TV; and (3) the difficulty and cost of repair or restoration after removal, etc. A security deposit increase does not imply a right to drill into or alter the leased premises. 11. When you may begin installation. You may start installation of your satellite dish, antenna, or related equipment only after you have: (1) signed this addendum; (2) provided us with written evidence of the liability insurance referred to in paragraph 9 of this addendum; (3) paid us the additional security deposit, if applicable, in paragraph 10; and (4) received our written approval, which may not be unreasonably withheld, of the installation materials and the person or company that will do the installation. 12. Miscellaneous. If additional satellite dishes or antennas are desired, an additional lease addendum must be executed. ________________________________________________ Signatures of All Residents _____________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________ Signature of Owner or Owner’s Representative X 150.00 1 Cedar Park 3111 Lakeline Crossing 100000.00 Joshua Skidds Erin Skidds 1.

Security Guidelines. We disclaim any express or implied warranties of security. We care about your safety and that of other occupants and guests. No security system is failsafe Even the best system can’t prevent crime. Always act as if security systems don’t exist since they are subject to malfunction, tampering, and hu- man error. The best safety measures are the ones you perform as a matter of common sense and habit. Inform all other occupants in your dwelling, including any children you may have, about these guidelines. We recom- mend that all residents and occupants use common sense and follow crime prevention tips, such as those listed below: • In case of emergency, call 911. Always report emergencies to authorities first and then contact the management. • Report any suspicious activity to the police first, and then follow up with a written notice to us. • Know your neighbors. Watching out for each other is one of the best defenses against crime.

Addendum. This is an addendum to the TAA Lease Contract for Apt. No. in the Apartments in , Texas OR the house, duplex, etc. located at (street address) in , Texas. 2. Use of Appliances. You (as residents) have permission from us (as owner) to install and use (check all that apply): q a washing machine and/or q a dryer in the dwelling unit described above, subject to the conditions in this addendum. Please remember that we do not select your washing machine or dryer, install them, maintain them, or use them. You are in the best position to prevent water, fire, smoke or other damage caused by: (1) a defective washing machine or dryer; (2) a washing machine or dryer accident; or (3) improper installation, maintenance or use of a washing machine or dryer. 3. Conditions. If your washing machine and/or dryer leaks, floods, causes a fire, causes smoke damage, or otherwise malfunctions or is misused, it can cause a lot of problems and a lot of damage to your unit and other units, as well as damage to your personal property and personal property of residents in other units. For these reasons, your right to install and use a washing machine and/or dryer in your unit is subject to the following conditions. You automatically agree to those conditions when connecting or using a washing machine and/or dryer in your unit. 4. Installation. You should be especially careful in your choice of a washing machine and/or dryer and in their installation, maintenance and use—just as if it were in your own home. You and all other residents, occupants, and guests in your unit must follow manufacturer’s instructions for the washing machine and/or dryer’s installation, maintenance, and use. Installation must be done by a professionally qualified person or company approved by us. We recommend that you have it professionally installed. 5. Responsibility for damage. You agree to assume strict liability for all damage to your unit and to other units and to personal property in your unit and other units if the washing machine and/or dryer leaks, floods, malfunctions or is misused, or in any other way causes damage—unless it is caused by us or our management company, or acts of God to the extent they couldn’t be mitigated by your action or inaction. That means you will be responsible for costs of removing water from carpets, replacing permanently damaged carpets, repainting, and any other repairs or damages to your unit and to other units, as well as damage to personal property in your unit and other units if, among other things: • the water or dryer vent hoses break or leak; or • the water or dryer vent hoses were incorrectly connected or did not have protective washers in the connections; or • the washing machine and/or dryer was overloaded, causing it to malfunction; or • the washing machine and/or dryer leaks or malfunctions for any other reason. • the owner’s insurance may not cover such damages, and the owner is under no obligation to have insurance that does cover such damages. 6. New hoses. When installing the washing machine, you must use new hoses since bursting or leaking hoses are the most common cause of water damage. Stainless braided water hoses are recommended. Similarly, you should use a new dryer vent hose when installing your dryer. 7. Inspection. You must not use the washing machine and/or dryer until management has inspected the installation. Such inspection does not relieve you of liability in the event of water, fire, smoke or other damage from your washing machine and/ or dryer. 8. Maintenance. You will have the sole responsibility for maintaining your washing machine and all related hardware. Such maintenance must include, but is not limited to, regularly cleaning lint from your dryer’s lint trap. 9. Insurance. At all times you must carry renter’s insurance that provides insurance coverage for damage to your personal belongings from accidental water discharge from your washing machine or other causes. Similarly, it must provide coverage for fire or smoke damage from your washing machine and/or dryer. It must also provide coverage for any potential liability, due to your fault, for water, fire, smoke or other damage to other units and to personal property of others. You must verify with your agent that such coverages are included in your policy and must furnish us a copy of the policy upon our request. \b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b Signatures of All Residents \b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b \b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b \b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b \b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b \b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b \b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b Signature of Owner or Owner’s Representative X Cedar Park 3111 Lakeline Crossing X Joshua Skidds Erin Skidds Texas Apartment Association WATER AND WASTEWATER SUBMETERING ADDENDUM 1. Addendum. This is an addendum to the TAA Lease Contract for Apt. No. in the Apartments in , Texas OR the house, duplex, etc. located at (street address) in , Texas. 2. PUC. Water conservation by submeter billing is encouraged by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC). Submeter billing is regulated by PUC rules, and a copy of the rules is attached to this addendum. This addendum complies with those rules. 3. Mutual Conservation Efforts. We agree to use our best efforts to repair any water leaks inside or outside your apartment no later than 7 days after we learn about them. You agree to use your best efforts to follow the water-conservation suggestions listed in the checklist below. 4. Submeter Billing Procedures. Your monthly rent under the TAA Lease does not include a charge for water and wastewater. Instead, you will receive a separate monthly bill from us for submetered water and wastewater use, as follows: (A) Your monthly water and wastewater bill will conform to all applicable rules of the PUC (see attached). (B) As permitted by state law, a service fee of % (not to exceed 9%) will be added to your monthly water-service charges. (C) No other administrative or other fees will be added to your bill unless expressly allowed by law or PUC rules. No other amounts will be included in the bill except your unpaid balances and any late fees (if incurred by you). If we fail to pay our mastermeter bill to the utility company on time and incur penalties or interest, no portion of these amounts will be included in your bill. (D) We will calculate your submetered share of the mastermetered water bill according to PUC rules, Section 24.281. (E) We will bill you monthly for your submetered water consumption from approximately the day of the month to the day of the month, the latter being our scheduled submeter-reading date. Your bill will be calculated in accordance with PUC rules and this Addendum and will be prorated for the first and last months you live in the unit. (F) PUC rules require us to publish figures from the previous calendar year if that information is available. The average monthly bill for all dwelling units in the apartment community last year was $ per unit, varying from $ for the lowest month’s bill to $ for the highest month’s bill for any unit. This information may or may not be relevant since the past amounts may not reflect future changes in utility-company water rates, weather variations, future total water consumption, changes in water-consumption habits of residents, and other unpredictable factors. (G) During regular weekday office hours, you may examine: (1) our water and wastewater bills from the utility company; (2) our calculation of your monthly submeter bill; and (3) any other information available to you under PUC rules. Please give us reasonable advance notice to gather the data. Any disputes relating to the computation of your bill will be between you and us. 5. Your Payment-Due Date. Payment of your submeter water and wastewater bill is due 16 days after the date it is postmarked or hand delivered to your apartment. You agree to mail or deliver payment to the place indicated on your bill so that payment is received no later than the due date. You will pay a late charge of 5% of your water and wastewater bill if we do not receive your payment on time. A Checklist of Water-Conservation Ideas for Your Dwelling In the bathroom . . . • Never put cleansing tissues, dental floss, cigarette butts, or other trash in the toilet. • When brushing your teeth, turn off the water until you need to rinse your mouth. • When shaving, fill the sink with hot water instead of letting the faucet run. • Take a shower instead of filling the tub and taking a bath. • Take a shorter shower. Showers may use up to half of your interior water consumption. • If you take a tub bath, reduce the water level by one or two inches. • Shampoo your hair in the shower. • Test toilets for leaks. Add a few drops of food coloring to the tank, but do not flush. Watch to see if the coloring appears in the bowl within a few minutes. If it does, the fixture needs adjustment or repair. A slow drip can waste as much as 170 gallons a day or 5,000 gallons per month. Report all leaks to management. • Don’t leave water running while cleaning bathroom fixtures. In the kitchen . . . • Run your dishwasher only when you have a full load. • If you wash dishes by hand, don’t leave the water running for washing or rinsing. Fill the sink instead. • Use your sink disposal sparingly, and never for just a few scraps. • Keep a container of drinking water in the refrigerator. • When cleaning vegetables, use a pan of cold water rather than letting the faucet run. • For cooking most food, use only a little water and place a lid on the pot. • Report all leaks to management. When doing the laundry . . . • Wash only full loads of laundry or else adjust the water level to match the size of the load (if you have this option). • Use cold water as often as possible to save energy and to conserve the hot water for uses that cold water cannot serve.

General Rules and Definitions (a) Purpose and scope. The provisions of this subchapter are intended to establish a comprehensive regulatory system to assure that the practices involving submetered and allocated billing of dwelling units and multiple use facilities for water and sewer utility service are just and reasonable and include appropriate safeguards for tenants. (b) Application. The provisions of this subchapter apply to apartment houses, condominiums, multiple use facilities, and manufactured home rental communities billing for water and wastewater utility service on a submetered or allocated basis.

An owner shall not change from submetered billing to allocated billing, except after receiving written approval from the commission after a demonstration of good cause and if the rental agreement requirements under subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this section have been met. Good cause may include: (1) equipment failures; or (2) meter reading or billing problems that could not feasibly be corrected. (e) Waiver of tenant rights prohibited. A rental agreement provision that purports to waive a tenant's rights or an owner's responsibilities under this subchapter is void. § 24.281. Charges and Calculations (a) Prohibited charges. Charges billed to tenants for submetered or allocated utility service may only include bills for water or wastewater from the retail public utility and must not include any fees billed to the owner by the retail public utility for any deposit, disconnect, reconnect, late payment, or other similar fees. (b) Dwelling unit base charge. If the retail public utility's rate structure includes a dwelling unit base charge, the owner shall bill each dwelling unit for the base charge applicable to that unit. The owner may not bill tenants for any dwelling unit base charges applicable to unoccupied dwelling units. (c) Customer service charge. If the retail public utility's rate structure includes a customer service charge, the owner shall bill each dwelling unit the amount of the customer service charge divided by the total number of dwelling units, including vacant units, that can receive service through the master meter serving the tenants. (d) Calculations for submetered utility service. The tenant's submetered charges must include the dwelling unit base charge and customer service charge, if applicable, and the gallonage charge and must be calculated each month as follows: (1) water utility service: the retail public utility's total monthly charges for water service (less dwelling unit base charges or customer service charges, if applicable), divided by the total monthly water consumption measured by the retail public utility to obtain an average water cost per gallon, liter, or cubic foot, multiplied by the tenant's monthly consumption or the volumetric rate charged by the retail public utility to the owner multiplied by the tenant's monthly water consumption; (2) wastewater utility service: the retail public utility's total monthly charges for wastewater service (less dwelling unit base charges or customer service charges, if applicable), divided by the total monthly water consumption measured by the retail public utility, multiplied by the tenant's monthly consumption or the volumetric wastewater rate charged by the retail public utility to the owner multiplied by the tenant's monthly water consumption; (3) service charge for manufactured home rental community or the owner or manager of apartment house: a manufactured home rental community or apartment house may charge a service charge in an amount not to exceed 9% of the tenant's charge for submetered water and wastewater service, except when; (A) the resident resides in a unit of an apartment house that has received an allocation of low income housing tax credits under Texas Government Code, Chapter 2306, Subchapter DD; or (B) the apartment resident receives tenant-based voucher assistance under United States Housing Act of 1937 Section 8, (42 United States Code, §1437f); and (4) final bill on move-out for submetered service: if a tenant moves out during a billing period, the owner may calculate a final bill for the tenant before the owner receives the bill for that period from the retail public utility. If the owner is billing using the average water or wastewater cost per gallon, liter, or cubic foot as described in paragraph (1) of this subsection, the owner may calculate the tenant's bill by calculating the tenant's average volumetric rate for the last three months and multiplying that average volumetric rate by the tenant's consumption for the billing period. (e) Calculations for allocated utility service. (1) Before an owner may allocate the retail public utility's master meter bill for water and sewer service to the tenants, the owner shall first deduct: (A) dwelling unit base charges or customer service charge, if applicable; and (B) common area usage such as installed landscape irrigation systems, pools, and laundry rooms, if any, as follows: (i) if all common areas are separately metered or submetered, deduct the actual common area usage; (ii) if common areas that are served through the master meter that provides water to the dwelling units are not separately metered or submetered and there is an installed landscape irrigation system, deduct at least 25% of the retail public utility's master meter bill; (iii) if all water used for an installed landscape irrigation system is metered or submetered and there are other common areas such as pools or laundry rooms that are not metered or submetered, deduct at least 5% of the retail public utility's master meter bill; or (iv) if common areas that are served through the master meter that provides water to the dwelling units are not separately metered or submetered and there is no installed landscape irrigation system, deduct at least 5% of the retail public utility's master meter bill. (2) To calculate a tenant's bill: (A) for an apartment house, the owner shall multiply the amount established in paragraph (1) of this subsection by: (i) the number of occupants in the tenant's dwelling unit divided by the total number of occupants in all dwelling units at the beginning of the month for which bills are being rendered; or (ii) the number of occupants in the tenant's dwelling unit using a ratio occupancy formula divided by the total number of occupants in all dwelling units at the beginning of the retail public utility's billing period using the same ratio occupancy formula to determine the total. The ratio occupancy formula will reflect what the owner believes more accurately represents the water use in units that are occupied by multiple tenants. The ratio occupancy formula that is used must assign a fractional portion per tenant of no less than that on the following scale: (I) dwelling unit with one occupant = 1; (II) dwelling unit with two occupants = 1.6; (III) dwelling unit with three occupants = 2.2; or (IV) dwelling unit with more than three occupants = 2.2 + 0.4 per each additional occupant over three; or (iii) the average number of occupants per bedroom, which shall be determined by the following occupancy formula. The formula must calculate the average number of occupants in all dwelling units based on the number of bedrooms in the dwelling unit according to the scale below, notwithstanding the actual number of occupants in each of the dwelling unit's bedrooms or all dwelling units: (I) dwelling unit with an efficiency = 1; (II) dwelling unit with one bedroom = 1.6; (III) dwelling unit with two bedrooms = 2.8; (IV) dwelling unit with three bedrooms = 4 + 1.2 for each additional bedroom; or (iv) a factor using a combination of square footage and occupancy in which no more than 50% is based on square footage. The square footage portion must be based on the total square footage living area of the dwelling unit as a percentage of the total square footage living area of all dwelling units of the apartment house; or (v) the individually submetered hot or cold water usage of the tenant's dwelling unit divided by all submetered hot or cold water usage in all dwelling units; (B) a condominium manager shall multiply the amount established in paragraph (1) of this subsection by any of the factors under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph or may follow the methods outlined in the condominium contract; (C) for a manufactured home rental community, the owner shall multiply the amount established in paragraph (1) of this subsection by: (i) any of the factors developed under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph; or (ii) the area of the individual rental space divided by the total area of all rental spaces; and (D) for a multiple use facility, the owner shall multiply the amount established in paragraph (1) of this subsection by: (i) any of the factors developed under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph; or (ii) the square footage of the rental space divided by the total square footage of all rental spaces. (3) If a tenant moves in or out during a billing period, the owner may calculate a bill for the tenant. If the tenant moves in during a billing period, the owner shall prorate the bill by calculating a bill as if the tenant were there for the whole month and then charging the tenant for only the number of days the tenant lived in the unit divided by the number of days in the month multiplied by the calculated bill. If a tenant moves out during a billing period before the owner receives the bill for that period from the retail public utility, the owner may calculate a final bill. The owner may calculate the tenant's bill by calculating the tenant's average bill for the last three months and multiplying that average bill by the number of days the tenant was in the unit divided by the number of days in that month. (f) Conversion to approved allocation method. An owner using an allocation formula other than those approved in subsection (e) of this section shall immediately provide notice as required under §24.279(c) of this title (relating to Rental Agreement) and either: (1) adopt one of the methods in subsection (e) of this section; or (2) install submeters and begin billing on a submetered basis; or (3) discontinue billing for utility services. § 24.283. Billing (a) Monthly billing of total charges. The owner shall bill the tenant each month for the total charges calculated under §24.281 of this title (relating to Charges and Calculations). If it is permitted in the rental agreement, an occupant or occupants who are not residing in the rental unit for a period longer than 30 days may be excluded from the occupancy calculation and from paying a water and sewer bill for that period. (b) Rendering bill. (1) Allocated bills shall be rendered as promptly as possible after the owner receives the retail public utility bill. (2) Submeter bills shall be rendered as promptly as possible after the owner receives the retail public utility bill or according to the time schedule in the rental agreement if the owner is billing using the retail public utility's rate. (c) Submeter reading schedule. Submeters or point-of-use submeters shall be read within three days of the scheduled reading date of the retail public utility's master meter or according to the schedule in the rental agreement if the owner is billing using the retail public utility's rate. (d) Billing period. (1) Allocated bills shall be rendered for the same billing period as that of the retail public utility, generally monthly, unless service is provided for less than that period. (2) Submeter bills shall be rendered for the same billing period as that of the retail public utility, generally monthly, unless service is provided for less than that period. If the owner uses the retail public utility's actual rate, the billing period may be an alternate billing period specified in the rental agreement. (e) Multi-item bill. If issued on a multi-item bill, charges for submetered or allocated utility service must be separate and distinct from any other charges on the bill. (f) Information on bill. The bill must clearly state that the utility service is submetered or allocated, as applicable, and must include all of the following: (1) total amount due for submetered or allocated water; (2) total amount due for submetered or allocated wastewater; (3) total amount due for dwelling unit base charge(s) or customer service charge(s) or both, if applicable; (4) total amount due for water or wastewater usage, if applicable; (5) the name of the retail public utility and a statement that the bill is not from the retail public utility; (6) name and address of the tenant to whom the bill is applicable; (7) name of the firm rendering the bill and the name or title, address, and telephone number of the firm or person to be contacted in case of a billing dispute; and (8) name, address, and telephone number of the party to whom payment is to be made. (g) Information on submetered service. In addition to the information required in subsection (f) of this section, a bill for submetered service must include all of the following: (1) the total number of gallons, liters, or cubic feet submetered or measured by point-of-use submeters; (2) the cost per gallon, liter, or cubic foot for each service provided; and (3) total amount due for a service charge charged by an owner of a manufactured home rental community, if applicable. (h) Due date. The due date on the bill may not be less than 16 days after it is mailed or hand delivered to the tenant, unless the due date falls on a federal holiday or weekend, in which case the following work day will be the due date. The owner shall record the date the bill is mailed or hand delivered. A payment is delinquent if not received by the due date. (i) Estimated bill. An estimated bill may be rendered if a master meter, submeter, or point-of-use submeter has been tampered with, cannot be read, or is out of order; and in such case, the bill must be distinctly marked as an estimate and the subsequent bill must reflect an adjustment for actual charges. (j) Payment by tenant. Unless utility bills are paid to a third-party billing company on behalf of the owner, or unless clearly designated by the tenant, payment must be applied first to rent and then to utilities. (k) Overbilling and underbilling. If a bill is issued and subsequently found to be in error, the owner shall calculate a billing adjustment. If the tenant is due a refund, an adjustment must be calculated for all of that tenant's bills that included overcharges. If the overbilling or underbilling affects all tenants, an adjustment must be calculated for all of the tenants' bills. If the tenant was undercharged, and the cause was not due to submeter or point-of-use submeter error, the owner may calculate an adjustment for bills issued in the previous six months. If the total undercharge is $25 or more, the owner shall offer the tenant a deferred payment plan option, for the same length of time as that of the underbilling. Adjustments for usage by a previous tenant may not be back billed to a current tenant. (l) Disputed bills. In the event of a dispute between a tenant and an owner regarding any bill, the owner shall investigate the matter and report the results of the investigation to the tenant in writing. The investigation and report must be completed within 30 days from the date the tenant gives written notification of the dispute to the owner. (m) Late fee. A one-time penalty not to exceed 5% may be applied to delinquent accounts. If such a penalty is applied, the bill must indicate the amount due if the late penalty is incurred. No late penalty may be applied unless agreed to by the tenant in a written lease that states the percentage amount of such late penalty. § 24.285. Complaint Jurisdiction (a) Jurisdiction. The commission has exclusive jurisdiction for violations under this subchapter. (b) Complaints. If an apartment house owner, condominium manager, manufactured home rental community owner, or other multiple use facility owner violates a commission rule regarding utility costs, the person claiming the violation may file a complaint with the commission and may appear remotely for a hearing. § 24.287. Submeters or Point-of-Use Submeters and Plumbing Fixtures (a) Submeters or point-of-use submeters. (1) Same type submeters or point-of-use submeters required. All submeters or point-of-use submeters throughout a property must use the same unit of measurement, such as gallon, liter, or cubic foot. (2) Installation by owner. The owner shall be responsible for providing, installing, and maintaining all submeters or point-of-use submeters necessary for the measurement of water to tenants and to common areas, if applicable. (3) Submeter or point-of-use submeter tests prior to installation. No submeter or point-of-use submeter may be placed in service unless its accuracy has been established. If any submeter or point-of-use submeter is removed from service, it must be properly tested and calibrated before being placed in service again. (4) Accuracy requirements for submeters and point-of-use submeters. Submeters must be calibrated as close as possible to the condition of zero error and within the accuracy standards established by the American Water Works Association (AWWA) for water meters. Point-of-use submeters must be calibrated as closely as possible to the condition of zero error and within the accuracy standards established by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) for point-of-use and branch-water submetering systems. (5) Location of submeters and point-of-use submeters. Submeters and point-of-use submeters must be installed in accordance with applicable plumbing codes and AWWA standards for water meters or ASME standards for point-of-use submeters, and must be readily accessible to the tenant and to the owner for testing and inspection where such activities will cause minimum interference and inconvenience to the tenant. (6) Submeter and point-of-use submeter records. The owner shall maintain a record on each submeter or point-of-use submeter which includes: (A) an identifying number; (B) the installation date (and removal date, if applicable); (C) date(s) the submeter or point-of-use submeter was calibrated or tested; (D) copies of all tests; and (E) the current location of the submeter or point-of-use submeter. (7) Submeter or point-of-use submeter test on request of tenant. Upon receiving a written request from the tenant, the owner shall either: (A) provide evidence, at no charge to the tenant, that the submeter or point-of-use submeter was calibrated or tested within the preceding 24 months and determined to be within the accuracy standards established by the AWWA for water meters or ASME standards for point-of-use submeters; or (B) have the submeter or point-of-use submeter removed and tested and promptly advise the tenant of the test results. (8) Billing for submeter or point-of-use submeter test. (A) The owner may not bill the tenant for testing costs if the submeter fails to meet AWWA accuracy standards for water meters or ASME standards for point-of-use submeters. (B) The owner may not bill the tenant for testing costs if there is no evidence that the submeter or point-of-use submeter was calibrated or tested within the preceding 24 months. (C) The owner may bill the tenant for actual testing costs (not to exceed $25) if the submeter meets AWWA accuracy standards or the point-of- use submeter meets ASME accuracy standards and evidence as described in paragraph (7)(A) of this subsection was provided to the tenant. (9) Bill adjustment due to submeter or point-of-use submeter error. If a submeter does not meet AWWA accuracy standards or a point-of-use submeter does not meet ASME accuracy standards and the tenant was overbilled, an adjusted bill must be rendered in accordance with §24.283(k) of this title (relating to Billing). The owner may not charge the tenant for any underbilling that occurred because the submeter or point-of-use submeter was in error. (10) Submeter or point-of-use submeter testing facilities and equipment. For submeters, an owner shall comply with the AWWA's meter testing requirements. For point-of-use meters, an owner shall comply with ASME's meter testing requirements. (b) Plumbing fixtures.

Addendum: This is an addendum to the Lease Contract for Apt. No. (the “Lease Contract”) of located at , (“the Property”). The terms of this addendum will control to the extent the terms of the Lease Contract and this addendum are in conflict. 2. Reason for Addendum: This Addendum modifies the Resident’s Lease Contract to allow the Property to charge certain property specific fees, as well as costs associated with the Resident’s use of goods or services at the Property (the “Property Specific Charges”). Where required by law, sales and/or use taxes will be collected on all applicable Property Specific Charges. 3. Property Specific Charges. The Property will charge the Resident’s ledger, on a monthly, one time or annual basis, as indicated below, in the amounts listed below for applicable fees, goods and services utilized at the property: 4. Allocation Procedures: Your monthly rent under the Lease Contract does not include a charge for the services and governmental fees indicated above. Instead, you will be receiving a separate bill from us each month for these services and governmental fees. We may include these items as separate and distinct charges as part of a multi-item bill. You agree to and we will allocate the indicated services and governmental fees for the apartment community based on one of the allocation methods below. Type of Service or Fee Monthly Fee Identifying Number Parking Space $ Garage $ Carport $ Storage Unit $ Garden Plot $ Bike Rack $ Type of Service or Fee Monthly, Move In, Renewal or at Move-In & Renewal Amount of Fee Common Area Maintenance $ Rent, Trash and/or Pest Control Billing Service Fee $ Processing Fee One Time $ Unauthorized Pet Fee Initial Per Occurrence $ 100.00 Unauthorized Pet Fee Daily Per Occurrence $ 10.00 Monthly Alarm System $ Inspection Fee $ Fire Assessment Fee $ Vacant Recovery Fee Per Occurrence $ Real Estate Tax $ Pest Control $ 3111 Lakeline Crossing I 13010 Ridgeline Blvd #3111, Cedar Park, TX 78613 0.00 0.00 0.00 Monthly 4.25 50.00 Monthly a. A percentage reflecting your apartment unit’s share of the total square footage in the apartment community, i.e., your unit’s square footage divided by the total square footage in all apartment units. b. A percentage reflecting your apartment unit’s share of the total number of people living in the apartment community, i.e., the number of people living in your apartment divided by the total number of people living in the entire apartment community for the month. (“People” for this purpose are all residents and occupants listed in the leases at the apartment community as having a right to occupy the respective units). c. Half of your allocation will be based on your apartment unit’s share of total square footage and half will be based on your share of total people living in the apartment community as described above. d.

City and Local Ordinances will determine when quiet hours are enforced. COURTESY PATROL We may sometimes provide courtesy patrol services at your Community. If courtesy patrol services are present at your Community, such measures should not be interpreted as providing additional security or protection from criminal activities. CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES As a reminder, always keep your doors and windows locked and be aware of your surroundings, especially at night. No one can ensure your personal safety, but by being alert and taking sensible precautions, you can minimize the likelihood that a criminal act will occur. If you have been the victim of a crime, suspect a crime is occurring on the Community, or notice anything unusual or suspicious, please contact law enforcement authorities immediately. Once you have notiﬁed law enforcement personnel, be sure to also notify the leasing oﬃce.

We reserve the right to pass through any fees or other costs associated with your failure to comply with such requirements. VEHICLE THEFT AND VANDALISM PRECAUTIONS Consider these simple tips to help prevent vandalism or theft when parking your vehicle: (1 )Always lock your vehicle; (2 )Never leave the keys in an unattended vehicle and do not hide a set of keys inside or outside of your vehicle; (3 )Do not leave valuables in plain sight; (4 )Do not keep your vehicle registration and title documentation inside the vehicle; (5 )Do not aﬃx your name and address to your keys. If your vehicle is vandalized or broken into, please contact law enforcement personnel. Once you have notiﬁed law enforcement personnel, please notify the oﬃce. Management is not responsible for theft or damage to vehicles. Page 12 of 25 YOUR APARTMENT ALARM SYSTEMS Your premises may be equipped with an alarm system. Some alarm systems only have audible alarms, and some are monitored by an alarm system company. Please check with your Community team to ﬁnd out what type of alarm system you may have. Activation, monitoring, and permit fees may apply. BALCONIES, PATIOS, HALLWAYS, BREEZEWAYS, STAIRWAYS AND YARDS All balconies, patios, hallways, breezeways, and stairways should be kept clean and free of debris. The balconies and patios may be used for outdoor furniture and decorative planters only. These items should not be displayed in common areas of the Community, including porches and entryways. Trash bags, trash cans, cleaning supplies, mops, brooms, boxes, coolers, or plastic storage tubs are prohibited from being stored on the patio or balcony. Clothing, garments, towels, rugs, or other laundry items are also prohibited from being hung on the patio or balcony. When observing a holiday, decorations are welcome to be displayed within your designated areas or balcony for a maximum of 3 0 days. The use of tiki torches, propane heaters, or open ﬂames are prohibited. We reserve the right to require you to remove any items from your patio/balcony or any common area such as the hallways, breezeways, stairways, etc. Animals should not be left unattended at any time. Your animals are not allowed to urinate or defecate on patios or balconies. If your patio or balcony needs maintenance attention, please place a request in the Resident Portal/Resident Portal App or contact the leasing oﬃce. Some communities may have yards. You are required to pick up and dispose of animal waste properly. Animals should not be left unattended in the yard. If a gate has been installed, you may utilize a lock on the gate. However, you must have the gate unlocked on scheduled dates of landscape maintenance. Any damage to the yard/fence (holes, broken fence areas or grass replacement due to pet waste and/or urine, etc.) will be billed at time of incident or upon move-out. BED BUGS Bed bugs are prevalent across the country, and we need to work together to keep them out of our Community. Bed bugs travel from place to place in the seams and folds of luggage, overnight bags, folded clothes, bedding, furniture, and anywhere else they can hide. You certify that, to your knowledge at move-in, you did not bring bed bug infested items into your apartment. Refrain from bringing furniture or other items that may be infested with bed bugs into your home. Bed bugs are small, ﬂat, parasitic insects that feed on the blood of people and animals. A newly hatched bedbug is semi-transparent, light tan in color and about the size of a poppy seed. Adult bed bugs are reddish-brown in color, wingless, about the size of an apple seed, and can live several months without eating. Bed bugs are usually found near the areas where people sleep. They can be found in mattress or box spring seams and tufts, sheets, pillowcases, headboards, dresser tables, upholstered furniture, baseboards, stuffed toys or any other clutter or objects around a bed. Bed bug infestation can be controlled with pest control management. Notify us immediately if you believe you have bed bugs. Once you report an infestation, we will schedule a pest control professional to inspect your apartment and conﬁrm that bed bugs are present. It is extremely important that you provide us with access to the apartment so that we can promptly address the issue. If a bed bug infestation is conﬁrmed, we will provide you with instructions about preparing your apartment and belongings for the pest control application. Failure to follow these instructions may result in ineffective treatment. In some cases, multiple treatments will be required. Please note that you may be held responsible for pest control expenses incurred to address a bed bug infestation in your apartment or any surrounding apartments, as allowed by local law, if you: (1 ) fail to notify us immediately of your discovery of the bed bugs; (2 ) are found to be responsible for the introduction of bed bugs to your apartment and the Community; (3 ) obstruct or inhibit our prompt access to the apartment to inspect and treat the infestation; and (4 ) fail to fully comply with the pest control preparation and treatment instructions. Your failure to follow instructions or to allow us access to your apartment hinders our ability to effectively treat your apartment for bed bugs. If you fail to cooperate with us in addressing these issues, we may act to recover possession of your apartment up to and including eviction. Repeated occurrences of bed bug infestation in your apartment may be considered a default under your lease. Page 13 of 25 CABINETS, DOORS, AND WOODWORK Cabinets and woodwork should be cleaned with mild soap and warm water. Paneled accent walls, if any, should be cleaned and polished using products speciﬁcally formulated for use on paneling. COUNTERTOPS/TUB SURFACES Please wipe up spills on your countertops promptly to avoid stains and use hot pads to protect kitchen counter surfaces. Do not cut items directly on your countertop with a sharp knife or other utensil. If you have granite or natural stone countertops, they have been sealed prior to your move-in. It is recommended that such countertops be sealed regularly to avoid staining. Our facilities team will be contacting you from time to time during your tenancy to schedule re-sealing. Avoid using harsh chemicals, especially acidic or alkaline products, on marble, granite, or natural stone countertops, as they can cause damage to polished stones. Granite and natural stone countertops should be cleaned using only warm, soapy water. Countertops, sinks, vanities, toilet bowls, bathtubs and bathtub enclosure walls should be cleaned using a liquid or spray cleaner. Abrasive powder cleaners (such as Comet, Ajax, and Bar Keepers Friend) should never be used. Bathtubs should be cleaned daily or after each use to prevent buildup that necessitates extra scrubbing. Never use a non-skid mat that has many small suction cups to hold it in place, as that could pull the ﬁnish off the tub. Mats that do not have suctions cups are ﬁne to use but should be removed after each use to allow the mat and tub to dry adequately and prevent microbial growth between the mat and the tub. When cleaning the tub, use a liquid detergent and a soft cloth. Do not use S.O.S., Brillo pads or steel wool. Do not use petroleum base cleaners such as Paint Thinner, Lacquer Thinner, Acetone or other harsh solvents. If the tub faucet starts to leak, put a service request in the Resident Portal/Resident Portal App or contact the leasing oﬃce. FIRE PREVENTION We urge you to make a regular inspection of your apartment for potential ﬁre hazards. Please take the following precautions to help eliminate ﬁre hazards. Immediately replace worn or frayed cords, plugs or wiring (or have them repaired by a qualiﬁed electrician). Rearrange lamps, media equipment, mechanical equipment (including furniture) and minor appliances to minimize use of extension cords and avoid overloading outlets with too many appliances or plugs. Do not smoke in bed and do not empty ashtrays into wastebaskets. Never leave burning candles unattended. Do not leave food cooking on the stove or in the oven unattended. Never throw water on a grease ﬁre; rather, pour baking soda or salt into the pan to extinguish the ﬁre. Do not store any combustible goods or materials that could increase the risk of ﬁre or damage in your apartment or in any storage space. In case of a ﬁre, call 9 1 1 ﬁrst, and once you are safe, call the oﬃce. Your apartment may be equipped with one or more smoke detectors and/or carbon monoxide detectors. You should test each smoke detector and/or carbon monoxide detector monthly and immediately replace dead or low batteries. Please place an EMERGENCY request in Resident Portal/Resident Portal App or call the leasing oﬃce to report smoke detector and/or carbon monoxide detector malfunctions or deﬁciencies. Neither you nor anyone else may remove, tamper with, or disable any smoke detectors, or carbon monoxide detectors in your apartment. If your building or apartment is equipped with automatic sprinklers, please refrain from hanging items from the pipes or sprinkler heads, as this can damage the sprinkler system and cause ﬂooding. You are responsible for any damage caused by tampering with or hanging items from any such sprinkler system. Your home may be equipped with a Fire Avert system and/or anti-tip device. The Fire Avert device will interrupt the power to your stove when a smoke alarm is activated. When installed, the anti- tip device, through a chain, connects a bracket on the rear of the stove to an anchor mounted to a wall-stud behind the stove. The chain connecting the two points helps to prevent your stove from tipping over should the door be opened, and weight is placed on the door when opened. If the Fire Avert has been activated, your stove will not be operational. Please submit a service request stating your stove does not work and one of our friendly maintenance team members will respond to your request. Page 14 of 25 FIREPLACES Never leave a ﬁreplace unattended while it is in use. Some communities are equipped with ﬁreplaces. Prior to using the ﬁreplace ensure the damper is open. Fireplaces are to be used for their intended purpose only. If your apartment has a wood burning ﬁreplace, please refrain from overloading the ﬁreplace with too much wood. Do not use the ﬁreplace as an incinerator to burn paper or other items not intended for use in a ﬁreplace. The ﬁreplace should not be used as a cooking device or to burn trash or newspaper. Duraﬂame types of logs may only be used as directed on the package in wood burning ﬁreplaces. Ashes need to be cleaned out after each use and disposed of properly. Placing live ashes in the trash receptacles, or on your patio or balcony, is prohibited. Do not store more than 1 /4 cord (2 ft x 2 ft) of wood on your patio or balcony. Natural gas ﬁreplaces are Clean-Air gas. Do not add any logs to a natural gas ﬁreplace. Do not leave a burning ﬁre unattended. If you are experiencing any airﬂow issues within your ﬁreplace, please stop using it immediately and place an EMERGENCY request in the Resident Portal/Resident Portal App or call the leasing oﬃce. You will be liable for all property loss proven to be due to negligence. FIREWORKS Fireworks are prohibited anywhere in the Community. FLOORS Care and maintenance of your carpet is your responsibility. The carpet should be vacuumed frequently. If you have spots on your carpet, call the oﬃce ﬁrst before attempting to remove them and we will suggest the best method. Tile and plank/vinyl ﬂooring should be cleaned with mild soap and water. Wax based products should not be used. GARAGES If you are renting a garage or one is provided to you, only motor vehicles and bicycles shall be parked in the garages. Perishable items and toxic, ﬂammable and/or explosive materials, including ﬁreworks, are prohibited from being stored in garages. Garages cannot be used for any other purpose (i.e., business, commercial) than a private garage and shall not be used in a way that will disturb other residents of the Community. If the garage door breaks or a garage is damaged due to accident or negligence, including the frame, walls, motor, sensors, etc., you will be responsible for the cost of repairs or replacement. The garage will be inspected for cleanliness and damages upon move-out. Items left in garage after move-out will be considered abandoned. Charging an electric vehicle should only be done through a designated charging station speciﬁc to electric vehicles. At no time should an adapter be used through a standard electrical outlet to charge your vehicle. Any resident who fails to comply with this section and tries to use a standard electrical outlet to charge their vehicle at any property shall be liable for all damage caused by the same. GRIEVANCES BH Management Services, LLC will attempt to communicate and resolve complaints and grievances to the satisfaction of all parties involved. GUEST POLICY Any guest staying longer than three (3 ) days will be considered an unauthorized occupant and must apply for residency, be approved, and sign the lease agreement. If the guest is unwilling to apply or does not meet our qualiﬁcations and continues to reside on site, management may proceed with eviction of all parties residing in the apartment. KEYS, ACCESS CARDS, REMOTES, AND LOCKS We will supply each resident with an apartment key, access code (applicable for smart connected communities), and a mailbox key. We may also provide remotes and other access devices. Resident is responsible for battery replacement in remotes and all other access devices except Smart Home devices.

LIGHTS All interior lighting ﬁxtures are in good working order when you move in. It is your responsibility to replace light bulbs with bulbs of the same type and wattage as needed. A service request can be submitted in the Resident Portal/Resident Portal App for any bulb replacement that requires a ladder to access. Resident is responsible for having the replacement bulb available when the service request is performed. Submit an EMERGENCY service request in the Resident Portal/Resident Portal App for any exterior lights that need to be repaired/replaced. MAINTENANCE Service Requests should be submitted in the Resident Portal/Resident Portal App or contact the leasing oﬃce. Maintenance requests will be completed Monday – Friday during the oﬃce hours posted at your Community. In case of a maintenance emergency, place an EMERGENCY request in the Resident Portal/Resident Portal App or call the leasing oﬃce. Maintenance emergencies consist of the following: ﬁre, door locks not secured (lockout is not an emergency), gas leak, no hot water, refrigerator not cooling, entry gate broken (closed only), clogged toilet (if only one toilet in apartment), ﬂood, electrical shortage, sewer back-up, no heat (if outside temperatures are under 5 5 º unless otherwise dictated by city ordinance) and no air conditioning (if outside temperatures are above 8 5 º unless otherwise dictated by city ordinance). For the safety of our employees HVAC calls received after dark or during inclement weather will be scheduled for the next day. It is not our policy to make appointments for maintenance work. MICROBIAL GROWTH PREVENTION It is our goal to maintain the highest quality living environment for our residents. You can help minimize microbial growth build-up, most commonly mold, in your apartment by taking the following actions. Open windows frequently to allow air and sunlight in when the weather is dry or run the fan on your furnace to circulate fresh air throughout your apartment. Move large objects just a few inches away from the inside of exterior walls to provide good air circulation. Page 16 of 25 In damp or rainy weather conditions, keep windows and doors closed. Please always maintain a temperature between 5 0 - and 8 0 -degrees Fahrenheit within your apartment. Clean and dust your apartment regularly. Regular vacuuming, mopping and use of environmentally safe household cleaners are important to remove household dirt and debris that microbial growth feed on. Periodically clean and dry the walls and ﬂoors around the sink, bathtub, shower, toilets, windows, and patio doors using a common household disinfecting cleaner. Regularly wipe down areas where moisture sometimes accumulates, like countertops, windows, and windowsills. Use the pre-installed bathroom fan when bathing or showering and allow the fan to run until all excess moisture has vented from the bathroom. Use the exhaust fans in your kitchen when cooking or while the dishwasher is running; and allow the fan to run until all excess moisture has vented from the kitchen. Limit houseplants to a reasonable number to keep the moisture level in your apartment at a minimum. If you have a clothes dryer, ensure that the vent is properly connected and be sure to clean the lint screen before every use. When washing clothes in warm or hot water, watch to make sure condensation does not build up within the washer and dryer closet; if condensation does accumulate, dry with a fan or towel. If you live in a humid climate, the use of a personal dehumidiﬁer will help regulate humidity levels in your apartment and create a more comfortable environment. Thoroughly dry any spills on carpeting. Do not overpack closets or storage areas. Do not allow damp or moist stacks of clothes or other cloth materials to lie in piles for an extended period. Place an EMERGENCY service request in the Resident Portal/Resident Portal App or to the leasing oﬃce if you see any of the following: evidence of a water leak, excessive moisture, or evidence of microbial growth in your apartment, storage room, garage, or any common area, failure or malfunction with your heating, ventilation or air-conditioning system, inoperable windows or doors and musty odors in your apartment. Do not block or cover any of the heating, ventilation, or air-conditioning ducts in your apartment. You are responsible for damage to the premises and your property as well as damage, loss or injury to you, your occupants and guests resulting from your failure to comply with the terms of this paragraph. OCCUPANCY STANDARDS In the absence of a local ordinance addressing occupancy limits, said occupancy limits will not exceed two people per apartment bedroom plus one (2 +1 ). Eﬃciency and studio apartments are considered one (1 ) bedroom for occupancy purposes. Apartments with dens can accommodate one (1 ) additional person. People over 2 4 months old will be included in the occupancy number for the apartment. The following standards lay out the max occupancies for the apartment units available at the Community: ● 1 BR occupancy – no more than three (3 ) individuals may reside in the unit; ● 2 BR occupancy – no more than ﬁve (5 ) individuals may reside in the unit; ● 3 BR occupancy – no more than seven (7 ) individuals may reside in the unit. PEST CONTROL Your unit will be exterminated as scheduled on your Community’s pre-determined dates or upon request. If you have a speciﬁc problem with pests, please place a request in the Resident Portal/Resident Portal App or call the leasing oﬃce. To help keep pests under control, we ask that you assist by maintaining a high standard of housekeeping. If you have a pet and it becomes necessary to spray for ﬂeas, you are responsible for paying the additional charge. To maintain decent, safe, and sanitary conditions, refusals of service will be re-scheduled within thirty (3 0 ) days and are subject to a charge. You may be responsible for a monthly fee billed on the ﬁrst (1 st) of every month as outlined in your lease contract. PIPE FREEZE PREVENTION During freezing months, thermostats should be set with heat at a minimum of 5 0 degrees. If you will be away for an extended period, let faucets drip. Make sure that all drains are free of blockage. If your drain is clogged or draining slowly, please place a request in the Resident Portal/Resident Portal App or by calling the leasing oﬃce. If the exterior temperature drops below 3 2 ° F you must keep the heat on and set to a minimum of 5 5 ° F. You must also open all closets, cabinets, and doors under sinks to assist in keeping plumbing ﬁxtures and plumbing pipes from freezing, and you must drip all the faucets in your apartment using both the hot and cold water. Leave the faucets dripping until the exterior temperature rises above 3 2 ° F. You must leave your HVAC system on, even if you leave for multiple days, and have it always set to auto. Page 17 of 25 PLUMBING If you have any of the following issues with your apartment unit’s plumbing, please place an EMERGENCY service request through the Resident Portal/Resident Portal App or contact the leasing oﬃce: ● The water in your apartment unit is not hot; ● Faucets in your apartment begin to leak; ● The toilet tank is continually running. If the caulked areas around your bathtub and tiles become cracked, broken, or chipped, place a service request through the Resident Portal/Resident Portal App or contact the leasing oﬃce. Paper towels, disposable diapers, sanitary napkins, tampons, moist towelettes (even if advertised as ﬂushable) and other comparable items should never be ﬂushed, as they inhibit normal drainage and cause damage to the sewer system. Should your toilet overﬂow, immediately turn off the water supply to the tank by turning the handle, located under the tank, clockwise. If the water supply cannot be turned off, lift the cover off the tank, reach inside, and push the ﬂapper ﬁrmly into the hole in the bottom of the tank and place an EMERGENCY service request through the Resident Portal/Resident Portal App or contact the leasing oﬃce. In cold weather, you must provide appropriate climate control and take measures to avoid freezing pipes in your apartment. If you control the climate in your apartment, always maintain a temperature of at least 5 5 degrees Fahrenheit. During freezing weather (i.e., when the outdoor temperature falls below 3 2 degrees Fahrenheit), you should keep sink cabinet doors open and leave faucets dripping when requested by the management oﬃce. If there is evidence of a water leak or excessive moisture in your apartment, any storage room, garage or other common area, and any failure or malfunction in the heating system on the premises, place an EMERGENCY service request in the Resident Portal/Resident Portal App. If your home includes a smart thermostat, our team will be notiﬁed of extreme temperatures and/or high humidity inside, and action will need to be taken by our service team to investigate the problem and make necessary repairs. If your home includes leak sensors in any location, action must be taken accordingly if moisture is detected. If you notice the leak detector alarming of moisture in a speciﬁc area, please place an EMERGENCY service request through the Resident Portal/Resident Portal App or contact the leasing oﬃce.

Damaged or missing equipment upon move-out will result in charges to your account. For support regarding smart home devices, please contact the Community. Page 19 of 25 SMOKE/CARBON MONOXIDE DETECTORS/FIRE EXTINGUISHERS/SPRINKLER HEADS Tampering with, disabling, or removing smoke, carbon monoxide detectors, ﬁre extinguishers or sprinkler heads is prohibited. SPACE HEATERS Space heaters with exposed heating elements, and gas/propane heaters are prohibited. Make sure to keep any approved space heaters away from curtains, upholstered furniture, and other combustibles. STORAGE SPACE AND STORAGE OF PERSONAL ITEMS ON THE COMMUNITY You may be provided with additional storage space for your apartment. Please do not place any goods or materials of any kind or description that are combustible, would increase ﬁre risk, or present a potential risk of any type in the storage areas or apartments. Heating/air conditioning or water heater closets are not to be used for storage purposes. The resident understands, warrants, and agrees that any storage or utilization of personal items at the Community by the resident and/or their accompanied guest(s) is done so at their own risk and peril. The resident understands, warrants and agrees that the neither the Community nor its Management Company shall assume any responsibility, nor shall they be liable in any way, for losses or damage to the personal property of a resident or their guest(s) while stored or utilized at the Community, including but not limited to those losses or damage caused by the negligence of another resident or employee, unless caused by the sole negligence of the Community or its Management Company. Furthermore, the resident covenants not to sue and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Community and its Management Company, along with their oﬃcers, directors, and employees for any claim of loss or damage to the personal property of another resident or their guest(s) while it is being stored or utilized at the Community. THERMOSTAT CONTROLS Most apartments are controlled by an individual thermostat. To ensure comfort and conserve energy, please set and maintain the thermostat at a consistent temperature. Keeping heating and air conditioning (“HVAC”) equipment, along with their associated vents, free of obstructions and personal property will help ensure peak performance of the systems. Failure to keep your apartment’s HVAC equipment and their associated vents free of obstructions and personal property could impair circulation, prevent proper venting of exhaust which may constitute a safety hazard, result in higher electric bills, and cause permanent damage to the premises. We will replace or clean your ﬁlters regularly or as requested. UTILITY TRANSFERS Upon move-in, you are responsible for the payment of all utilities as set forth in your lease. You must plan to have the service transferred to your name and service to start by the ﬁrst (1 st) day of move in. The names and phone numbers for utility providers are available to the resident in the Community’s leasing oﬃce. If any utility for which you are responsible for payment under the terms of your lease is transferred back into the Community’s name before you move out or surrender the apartment, you will be liable for charges in accordance with your current lease contract and those charges will be added to your resident ledger for payment. WALLS Other than hanging pictures, you may not install any ﬁxtures, major appliances (to include window A/C units), devices, signs, or make alterations or other additions to your apartment without our express written permission. Any decorations, alterations, additions, or ﬁxtures undertaken by the resident will be done at the residents own expense and in accordance with the Community’s standards and speciﬁcations. Any such decorations, alterations, additions, or ﬁxtures undertaken by the resident shall remain as part of the apartment at the end of your lease term unless otherwise agreed to by the Community in writing. Any decorations, alterations, additions, or ﬁxtures that are made without the Community’s express, written permission will be removed at the resident’s expense at the end of their lease term. You will not, without our permission, install or use any electrical equipment that will overload the existing wiring installations in your apartment or building. Page 20 of 25 Mirror tiles, contact paper, wallpaper and other wall coverings with adhesive backing are not permitted. The resident is responsible for any damage, including holes, to the walls of their apartment during your occupancy term. WATER BEDS Waterbeds are allowed only on ground ﬂoor apartments and are acceptable only with proof of insurance for any damages that may occur. Anyone not complying with this regulation faces the possibility of eviction and will be responsible for any damage caused by the waterbed. WHILE YOU ARE AWAY We recommend some simple tips before leaving on a trip or vacation. Uncollected newspapers and an overﬂowing mailbox are indicators that you are absent. It is a good idea to suspend your newspaper delivery and request your local post oﬃce to hold your mail while you are away. If you use social media to communicate with others, be cautious about advertising your absence from home. Dispose of your garbage and unwrapped food in your cupboards. Close and lock all windows and doors. Ensure your coffee maker, toaster, and other countertop appliances are unplugged or off. To avoid frozen pipes while you are away in the winter, please set your thermostat to at least 5 0 degrees Fahrenheit. If a rent payment is due while you are away, arrange to ensure timely payment. As a reminder, you can sign up for automatic recurring rent payments or make payments via our Resident Portal/Resident Portal App. WINDOWS Your apartment may have drapes, miniblinds, and/or vertical blinds. The louvers should be in the open position when operating to prevent damage. Continuous loop pull cords on mini blinds or vertical blinds should not be tied together. Loops pose a safety hazard to small children. If any of your pull cords are looped together, please submit a service request in the Resident Portal/Resident Portal App or contact the leasing oﬃce. If you wish to install your own window coverings, you must ﬁrst obtain our written permission and return the Community’s window coverings in the manner speciﬁed by the management staff. All drapes, shades and other window coverings must have a white backing. This provides a standard appearance from the outside. Except as otherwise permitted by law, signs in windows are not permitted. Residents are responsible for the replacement of damaged blinds. Installation of Window Air Conditioning Units of any kind is prohibited. APPLIANCES Never leave an appliance unattended while it is in use. Appliances provided by the Community will be repaired if they stop working. However, before you submit a service request or notify the oﬃce, check the electrical cord to ensure it is ﬁrmly plugged into the outlet and check the circuit breaker to see if it is tripped to the off position. If these appear in order, submit a service request in the Resident Portal/Resident Portal App or call the leasing oﬃce. COMMUNITY SUPPLIED WASHERS AND DRYERS Check and clean the lint trap on your dryer before each use. Do not dry plastic items. Do not store anything on top of or near the dryer or obstruct dryer vents. Inspect your washer and dryer hoses and vents regularly and report any maintenance issues to management. If you are experiencing any airﬂow issues or believe there may be a blockage in the dryer vent from the exterior wall to the interior unit connection point, please stop using immediately and contact the Community oﬃce by placing a service request in the Resident Portal/Resident Portal App or call the leasing oﬃce. When using your washer or dryer, follow manufacturer’s requirements on load limitations. Never loosen any water connection to the washing machine box without our prior permission. You are responsible for any damage, including, without limitation, ﬂooding, caused by tampering with any water connection. Page 21 of 25 THE DISHWASHER Food particles left on dishes will jam the dishwasher. Please scrape and rinse every dish under running water before loading it in the dishwasher. Do not crowd dishes, cups and glasses, or silverware so the water can freely circulate. For maximum eﬃciency, avoid covering the center hole in the drawer rack. Use only dishwasher detergent products. Do not use regular dish soap or laundry detergents, as they will cause the dishwasher to overﬂow. You can save power and reduce your electric bill by waiting to run your dishwasher until you have a full load. However, do not leave dirty dishes in the dishwasher for a long time. THE DISPOSAL Your apartment may or may not be provided with a garbage disposal. A garbage disposal is a convenient appliance if used properly. Do not overload it. The safety overload on the motor will engage if the disposal is overloaded and turn it off. To reset the safety overload, wait three or four minutes for the motor to cool and push the reset button located on the garbage disposal. Keep your hands and any other objects out of the disposal when it is running. For best operation, follow these steps: Push, but do not stuff food refuse through the splash guard into the disposal. A mixed load of hard and soft waste works best. Turn cold water on to full ﬂow. Flip starting switch “on.” Allow disposal to operate until grinding sound diminishes and becomes a humming sound. Turn switches off and run cold water for a few moments longer. Do not discard the following items in your disposal: metal, glass, string, coffee grounds, olive or fruit pits, plastic, grease, paper, cigarettes, bones, banana peels, oyster or clam shells, eggshells, dish rags, celery, corn husks, or other nonfood items. If a spoon, bottle cap or other item becomes lodged in the disposal, make sure the disposal is turned off before you attempt to retrieve the object. The disposal is self-cleaning. Do not use caustic drain cleaners at any time. A lemon or orange rind or baking soda will keep the disposal odor-free. THE OVEN AND THE RANGE Never leave the oven or the range unattended while it is in use. Your range is equipped with separate controls for the oven, broiler, and each of the top burners. If you have never used an electric or gas range before, please let us know. We will be happy to instruct you on its proper use. Cooking is only allowed in the kitchen area. No cooking equipment of any kind is allowed in the living areas of your home. Clean the top burner drip pans with mild soap and water, appliances, or glass cleaner regularly. If your burner drip pans become spotted with grease or burned-on food, use a scouring pad to clean them. If they need a more thorough cleaning, drip pans can be lifted out of the range by raising the burner. Clean your oven regularly. A dirty oven and broiler area reduces the eﬃciency of your oven and could result in improperly cooked foods. Using the broiler tray will reduce the cleaning and maintenance needed in the oven. Make sure to keep the stove areas free of newspapers, mail, and other combustible materials. Make sure not to place electrical wiring close to the stove. Use a good oven cleaner and follow directions. Wear rubber gloves and make sure the cleaner does not contact your skin, ﬂoor, countertop, or any other surface. Never use any sharp instruments to clean the oven. If you have a self- cleaning oven, follow the cleaning instructions enclosed with the range. Remove vent hood ﬁlters regularly and clean them in hot, soapy water. Clean the outside with a non-abrasive appliance or glass cleaner. If your apartment is equipped with a ﬁre safety device, such as Fire Avert or similar, tampering with or removal is prohibited. THE REFRIGERATOR The temperature control dial may be set at whatever position best suits your needs. If your refrigerator is not frost-free, please consult the oﬃce for defrosting instructions. Clean the outside of your refrigerator with appliance or glass cleaner. Abrasive cleaning powders and metal sponges should be avoided. Wipe down the shelves and interior surfaces using mild soap and water. Regular Page 22 of 25 cleaning and a fresh, open box of baking soda placed on a shelf and changed monthly will keep your refrigerator odor-free. MOVING OUT When it is time for you to move out, we have a few simple requirements: You must fulﬁll all the terms and conditions of your lease and leave owing no money to the Community. You must give us formal written notice, within the time period stated in your lease, of your intention to move out. You must vacate and remove all your personal property and return all keys, access cards, and remotes to us on or before your scheduled move-out date. If applicable, all smart home devices (locks, thermostats, hubs, light switches, leak sensors, plugs, motion sensors, etc.) must be left in the apartment. Missing or damaged equipment will incur charges to your account. You must provide us with a valid forwarding address. If you want to be present for a move-out inspection of your apartment, contact the oﬃce before your scheduled move-out date. If no prior arrangements are made for you to be present, we will inspect your vacant apartment after you move out. A copy of the move out inspection form may be obtained by contacting the Community. As required by your lease, you must leave your apartment in the same clean, undamaged, and ready-to-rent condition as when you moved in, taking ordinary wear and tear into account. By way of example, ordinary wear and tear would include such things as traﬃc wear across the carpet, but not cigarette burns or stains. When you vacate your apartment, any personal property left in your apartment will be considered abandoned and may be disposed of, without liability to us, subject to applicable laws. If we incur costs for cleaning and/or repairing your apartment or for removing trash or other items left behind after you move out, we will pass those costs through to you. Security Deposit Deductions and Other Charges. You’ll be liable for the following charges, if applicable: unpaid rent; unpaid utilities; unreimbursed service charges; repairs or damages caused by negligence, carelessness, accident, or abuse, including stickers, scratches, tears, burns, stains, or unapproved holes; replacement cost of our property that was in or attached to the apartment and is missing; replacing dead or missing alarm or detection-device batteries at any time; utilities for repairs or cleaning; trips to let in company representatives to remove your telephone, internet, television services, or rental items (if you so request or have moved out); trips to open the apartment when you or any guest or occupant is missing a key; unreturned keys; missing or burned-out light bulbs; removing or rekeying unauthorized security devices or alarm systems; packing, removing, or storing property removed or stored according to your Lease Contract; removing illegally parked vehicles; special trips for trash removal caused by parked vehicles blocking dumpsters; false security-alarm charges unless due to our negligence; animal-related charges outlined in your Lease Contract; government fees or ﬁnes against us for violation (by you, your occupants, or your guests) of local ordinances relating to alarms and detection devices, false alarms, recycling, or other matters; late-payment and returned-check charges; and other sums due under this Lease. You will be liable to us for charges for replacing any keys and access devices referenced in your Lease Contract if you do not return them all on or before your actual move-out date; and accelerated rent if you have violated the Lease. We may also deduct from your security deposit our reasonable costs incurred in rekeying security devices required by law if you vacate the apartment in breach of your Lease Contract. Upon receipt of your move-out date and forwarding address in writing, the security deposit will be returned (less lawful deductions) with an itemized accounting of any deductions, no later than 30 days after surrender or abandonment, unless state or local law provide otherwise. Any refund may be by one payment jointly payable to all residents and distributed to any one resident we choose or distributed equally among all residents.
