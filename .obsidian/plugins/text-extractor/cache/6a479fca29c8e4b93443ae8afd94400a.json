You may be able to take the EIC for 2022 if your adjusted gross income (AGI) is less than a certain amount. The amount of the credit is based on income and family size.

You can’t take the EIC if your investment income is more than the specified amount for 2022 or if income is earned for services provided while you were an inmate at a penal institution.
