## Misc

- [ ] # Complete Library
	This is where I store everything I have ever played, watched, or read and my opinion of it.
- [ ] ## WIP
	This is a work-in-progress. I plan to keep this demo vault as updated as my real vault when it comes to this database. What you see here is what is stored in my own notes.
	
	Anything not with a picture is a WIP. I added it to keep track and to have it here but I just haven't added my ratings nor the picture.
- [ ] ## Why keep this?
	I decided to keep this library so I can go back and see where I am on a series (if it is new or I am rewatching) and see what I thought about it and for reminiscing in the future.

	> ![[Palworld Banner.png]]
	> ‚≠ê ‚≠ê ‚≠ê
	
	I played almost 200 hours of [[Palworld]] and it is a fun game but there is not much to do in the game and not engaging once you have a fully set up base. #PC #Steam
- [ ] > [!left] Sims 3 & 4
	> ![[Sims 4 banner.png]]
	> ‚≠ê ‚≠ê
	
	I played a lot of [[The Sims 3 and 4]] and have close to 2000 hours but lately what EA is doing with the game is shitty so I don't play and haven't played in almost a year. #EA #PC
