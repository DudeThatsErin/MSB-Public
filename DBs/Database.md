	I created several islands on [[Animal Crossing New Horizons]] and I loved playing this game on the Switch. #Switch

	I played almost 200 hours of [[Palworld]] and it is a fun game but there is not much to do in the game and not engaging once you have a fully set up base. #PC #Steam

	> ‚≠ê ‚≠ê
	
	I played a lot of [[The Sims 3 and 4]] and have close to 2000 hours but lately what EA is doing with the game is shitty so I don't play and haven't played in almost a year. #EA #PC

	This is my favorite movie. [[The Parent Trap (2009)]] has always been and will always be my favorite movie. I still have yet to try oreos with peanut butter but plan to! #Digital #Blu-Ray
