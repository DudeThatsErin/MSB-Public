# Plot
On the tropical island of Paraiso, Plum Lockhart has a new zest for life. Her villa rental company is growing like a weed, she's solved a couple of pesky murders, and things with her longtime crush are finally starting to heat up.
Plum does sometimes miss her sparkly life in the Big Apple, so she's thrilled when she gets an invite to dinner on a yacht where she can mingle with famous singers, up-and-coming stars, society swans, and billionaires. But Plum does wonder what kind of secrets hide beneath the glitz and glamour.
Days later, one of the servers from the yacht-a girl with dragonfruit tattoo-washes up dead, and Plum's sweet bit of paradise quickly goes sour. As the ship prepares to set sail across the Caribbean. Plum hops aboard to investigate the case, undercover. But the best-laid plans turn deadly as it becomes clear someone on the boat is a murderer, and Plum may be the next victim...
