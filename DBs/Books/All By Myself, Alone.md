# Plot
Feeling the humiliating arrest of her husband-to-be, Celia Killbride, a jewelry expert, hopes to escape from public attention by lecturing on a brand-new cruise ship-the *Queen Charlotte*.
On board, she meets eighty-six-year-old "Lady Em." Immensely wealthy, Lady Em plans to wear her priceless emerald Cleopatra necklace, which, according to legend, places a deadly curse on whoever brings it to sea.
The *Queen Charlotte* is 3 days out and Lady Em is found dead-and the necklace is missing. Is it the work of her devoted assistant or her lawyer-executor? Is it the scholar who is lecturing on board, or a guest on the ship who is planning to spread his wife's ashes at sea? Or is it the young lawyer who tried to persuade Lady Em to return the necklace to Egypt? The list suspects is large and growing.
Celia does not realize that her friendship with Lady Em has not escaped the notice of the killer. With the help of her new friends WIlly and Alvirah Meehan, she must avoid the danger that awaits her before the ship reaches its final destination...
