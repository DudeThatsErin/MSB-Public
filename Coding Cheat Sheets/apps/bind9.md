# BIND9

BIND9 (Berkeley Internet Name Domain version 9) is an open-source [[Coding Cheat Sheets/networking/dns/dns]] (Domain Name System) software system. It is the most widely used DNS server software on the Internet and is maintained by the Internet Systems Consortium (ISC). BIND9 provides a robust and scalable platform for resolving domain names into IP addresses and vice versa, as well as supporting advanced DNS features such as [[DNSSEC]] (DNS Security Extensions), dynamic updates, and incremental zone transfers. BIND9 runs on a variety of operating systems, including [[Coding Cheat Sheets/linux/linux]], [[Unix]], and [[Windows]], and is highly configurable and extensible through the use of plugins and modules.

## Installation

ISC provides executables for Windows and packages for [Ubuntu](Coding%20Cheat%20Sheets/linux/distros/ubuntu.md), [CentOS](Coding%20Cheat%20Sheets/linux/distros/centos.md), [Fedora](Coding%20Cheat%20Sheets/linux/distros/fedora.md)  and [Debian](Coding%20Cheat%20Sheets/linux/distros/debian.md) - BIND 9 ESV, Debian - BIND 9 Stable, Debian - BIND 9 Development version. Most operating systems also offer BIND 9 packages for their users. These may be built with a different set of defaults than the standard BIND 9 distribution, and some of them add a version number of their own that does not map exactly to the BIND 9 version.


### Ubuntu Linux

BIND9 is available in the Main repository. No additional repository needs to be enabled for BIND9.

```sh 
sudo apt install bind9
```


### Ubuntu Docker

As part of the [Long Term Supported OCI Images](https://ubuntu.com/security/docker-images), Canonical offers Bind9 as a hardened and maintained [Docker](Coding%20Cheat%20Sheets/docker/docker.md).

```sh
docker run -d --name bind9-container -e TZ=UTC -p 30053:53 ubuntu/bind9:9.18-22.04_beta
```

## Configuration

BIND 9 uses a single configuration file called `named.conf`, which is typically located in either `/etc/bind`, `/etc/namedb` or `/usr/local/etc/namedb`.

The `named.conf` consists of `logging`, and `options` blocks, and `category`, `channel`, `directory`, `file` and `severity` statements.

### Named Config

```conf
options {
	...
};

zone "domain.tld" {
	type primary;
	file "domain.tld";
};
```

### Zone File

Depending on the functionality of the system, one or more `zone` files is required.

```conf
; base zone file for domain.tld
$TTL 2d    ; default TTL for zone

$ORIGIN domain.tld. ; base domain-name

; Start of Authority RR defining the key characteristics of the zone (domain)
@         IN      SOA   ns1.domain.tld. hostmaster.domain.tld. (
                                2022121200 ; serial number
                                12h        ; refresh
                                15m        ; update retry
                                3w         ; expiry
                                2h         ; minimum
                                )

; name server RR for the domain
           IN      NS      ns1.domain.tld.

; mail server RRs for the zone (domain)
        3w IN      MX  10  mail.domain.tld.

; domain hosts includes NS and MX records defined above
; plus any others required
; for instance a user query for the A RR of joe.domain.tld will
; return the IPv4 address 192.168.254.6 from this zone file
ns1        IN      A       192.168.254.2
mail       IN      A       192.168.254.4
joe        IN      A       192.168.254.6
www        IN      A       192.168.254.7

```

#### SOA (Start of Authority)

A start of authority record is a type of resource record in the Domain Name System ([DNS](networking/dns.md)) containing administrative information about the zone, especially regarding zone transfers. The SOA record format is specified in RFC 1035.

```conf
@         IN      SOA   ns1.domain.tld. hostmaster.domain.tld. (
                                2022121200 ; serial number
                                12h        ; refresh
                                15m        ; update retry
                                3w         ; expiry
                                2h         ; minimum
                                )
```

## Forwarders

DNS forwarders are servers that resolve DNS queries on behalf of another DNS server.

To configure bind9 as a forwarding DNS server, you need to add a `forwarders` clause inside the `options` block. The `forwarders` clause specifies a list of IP addresses of other DNS servers that bind9 will forward queries to.

```conf
options {
    // ... other options ...
    forwarders {
        8.8.8.8; // Google Public DNS
        1.1.1.1; // Cloudflare DNS
    };
};
```

---
## Access Control

To configure permissions in BIND9, you can use the “acl” statement to define access control lists, and then use the “allow-query” and “allow-transfer” statements to specify which hosts or networks are allowed to query or transfer zones.

```conf
acl "trusted" {
    192.168.1.0/24;
    localhost;
};

options {
    // ...
    allow-query { any; };
    allow-transfer { "trusted"; };
    // ...
};

zone "example.com" {
    // ...
    allow-query { "trusted"; };
    // ...
};
```

In this example, we define an ACL called “trusted” that includes the 192.168.1.0/24 network and the local host. We then specify that hosts in this ACL are allowed to transfer zones, and that any host is allowed to query.

For the “example.com” zone, we specify that only hosts in the “trusted” ACL are allowed to query.

You can also use other ACL features, such as “allow-recursion” and “allow-update”, to further control access to your DNS server.

## Dynamic Updates

Dynamic updates in BIND allow for the modification of DNS records in real-time without having to manually edit zone files. 

### Secure DNS updates with TSIG Key

A TSIG (Transaction SIGnature) key is a shared secret key used to authenticate dynamic DNS updates between a DNS client and server. It provides a way to securely sign and verify DNS messages exchanged during dynamic updates.

To create a TSIG key for use with dynamic updates, the `tsig-keygen` command can be used.

```
tsig-keygen -a hmac-sha256
```

To add the TSIG key to the zone configuration, the "key" statement must be added to the "allow-update" statement in the named.conf file. For example:

```
zone "example.com" {
    type master;
    file "example.com.zone";
    allow-update { key "tsig-key"; };
};
```

In this example, the "allow-update" statement now uses the TSIG key, to allow updates to the "example.com" zone.
