# Proxmox Cheat-Sheet

Proxmox Virtual Environment (Proxmox VE or PVE) is a hyper-converged infrastructure open-source software. It is a hosted hypervisor that can run operating systems including Linux and Windows on x64 hardware. It is a Debian-based Linux distribution with a modified Ubuntu LTS kernel and allows deployment and management of virtual machines and containers. Proxmox VE includes a web console and command-line tools, and provides a REST API for third-party tools. Two types of virtualization are supported: container-based with LXC (starting from version 4.0 replacing OpenVZ used in version up to 3.4, included), and full virtualization with KVM. It includes a web-based management interface.

Proxmox VE is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License, version 3.

## Web GUI

```shell
# Restart web GUI
service pveproxy restart
```

## Resize Disk

### Increase disk size

Increase disk size in the GUI or with the following command

```shell
qm resize 100 virtio0 +5G
```

### Decrease disk size

> Before decreasing disk sizes in Proxmox, you should take a backup!

1. Convert qcow2 to raw: `qemu-img convert vm-100.qcow2 vm-100.raw`
2. Shrink the disk `qemu-img resize -f raw vm-100.raw 10G`
3. Convert back to qcow2 `qemu-img convert -p -O qcow2 vm-100.raw vm-100.qcow2`
