# SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)

**SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)** is a networking protocol for [mail](mail.md) transfer. It's used to send emails from a mail client to a mail server and between mail servers.

Server-to-Server communication is typically done over port `25`. Client-to-Server communication is typically done over port `587`. Alternatively, port `465` can be used for client-to-server communication with [TLS](Coding%20Cheat%20Sheets/networking/tls.md).
