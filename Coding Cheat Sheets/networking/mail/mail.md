# Mail

**Mail** or **Email** is a digital method of exchanging messages between people using devices like computers, tablets, and mobile phones. Today's email systems are based on a store-and-forward model, allowing users to send and receive messages without needing to be online simultaneously.

## Mail Protocols

Mail Servers typically use the [SMTP](mail-smtp.md) protocol to send and receive mail. The [IMAP](mail-imap.md) and [POP3](mail-pop3.md) protocols are used to retrieve mail from a mail server.

## Mail Server Records

Mail Servers are identified by [MX Records](Coding%20Cheat%20Sheets/networking/dns/dns-record-mailserver.md) in the [DNS](Coding%20Cheat%20Sheets/networking/dns/dns.md) system.
