# DNSSEC

DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions) is a set of security extensions to the [[Coding Cheat Sheets/networking/dns/dns]] (Domain Name System) protocol that provides authentication and integrity checking for DNS data. DNSSEC uses digital signatures to ensure that DNS responses have not been modified in transit and that they come from an authorized source. 

With DNSSEC, each zone in the DNS hierarchy is signed with a private key, and the corresponding public key is published in the DNS. When a DNS resolver receives a DNS response, it can use the public key to verify the digital signature and ensure that the response has not been tampered with. If the signature is valid, the resolver can be confident that the response is authentic and has not been modified in transit.

DNSSEC provides several benefits, including:

- Data integrity: DNSSEC ensures that DNS responses have not been modified in transit, preventing DNS spoofing and other types of attacks that rely on DNS data tampering.
- Authentication: DNSSEC allows DNS resolvers to authenticate the source of DNS responses, providing an additional layer of security against DNS cache poisoning and other attacks.
- Trust hierarchy: DNSSEC allows for the creation of a trust hierarchy in the DNS, with each zone in the hierarchy being responsible for signing its own data and delegating trust to its child zones.

DNSSEC is supported by most modern DNS servers and resolvers, and is becoming increasingly important as a tool for securing the Internet's infrastructure.
