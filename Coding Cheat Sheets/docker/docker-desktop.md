# Docker Desktop

Docker Desktop is a software application that enables developers to build, package, and run applications using Docker containers on their local machines. It provides an easy-to-use graphical interface and includes the necessary tools and components for managing Docker containers, such as the Docker engine, images, and networking capabilities.

## Installing Docker Desktop

Docker Desktop is available for Windows and macOS. You can download the installer from the [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

## Troubleshooting

The `com.docker.diagnose check` command can be used to run a diagnostic check on Docker Desktop for Mac.
