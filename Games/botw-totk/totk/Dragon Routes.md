# Zelda/Light Dragon
Goes all around Hyrule. 
> The Light Dragon is the most elusive of the bunch, as the creature’s route encompasses the entire outskirts of Hyrule. Among the places the Light Dragon flies are Goronbi Lake, Zora’s Domain, [Hateno Village](https://www.polygon.com/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-guide/23724339/hateno-village-location), Lindor’s Brow, and Thyphlo Ruins. The upside is that once you do find the Light Dragon, it won’t attack you when you get close to it.
