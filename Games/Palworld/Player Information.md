# Player Information
Clipped from: [https://palworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Players](https://palworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Players)  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Characters played by real life people are referred to as **Players** in [*Palworld*](https://palworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Palworld)*. *  
Players can do a multitude of activities in the game, including interacting with [Pals](https://palworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Pals).   
## Shield  
The player's Shield is represented by a blue bar placed over the top of their health. Damage dealt to the player is dealt to the player's Shield instead; additionally, large hits which exceed the player's current Shield do not "overflow" into the player's Health, thus guaranteeing the player survives at least one hit. Partially or fully depleted shields will recover over time, faster than the player's health does.  
The player has 0 Shield by default, and they need to equip an item to their Shield slot in order to increase it. The valid Shield items include:  
Shield Amount

[Hyper Shield](https://palworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Hyper_Shield)  | 1045 | 
  
## Health  
[Health](https://palworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Health) is represented by a green bar and a heart icon. When the player's <a href="https://palworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Health">Health</a> reaches 0, they are downed and will drop a <a href="https://palworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Death_Chest">Death Chest</a>.   
### Going Down  
If a player's Health goes down to 0, they will go down if a  
![Image-5](Player Information\PlayerInformation_5.png)  
Guild member is online and currently alive. Otherwise, they will die.  
### Death  
When a player dies, they drop the items in their inventory and the [Pals](https://palworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Pals) in their party. The inventory will be stored in a small bag, called **Death Chest** by the game files.   
The death chest and Pals dropped will be marked on the map and compass with a  
![Image-6](Player Information\PlayerInformation_6.png)  
icon, and a beacon that can be seen from a far distance will be shown to the player, until they or a guild member claims the bag and its items. If the world settings allow it, other players may also take the bag and Pals.  
The despawn timer for the bag and Pals are unknown.  
Items dropped can be picked at any elevation, as long as the player is close to the beacon.  
## Hunger  
[Food](https://palworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Food) is represented by an orange bar and a bread icon. The player must consume <a href="https://palworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Food">Food</a> in order to keep <a href="https://palworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Hunger">Hunger</a> at bay, and if the player's Food depletes too much, the player's stats will decrease, and eventually they will start to take starvation damage. Note that starvation damage cannot down the Player or their Pals.   
## Temperature  
Temperature is represented by a notched semi-circle with an arrow pointing in it. In extremely hot or cold environments, the arrow will move in the respective direction, and if the arrow is in one of the colored rectangles, the player will take damage over time, ignoring Shields. The intensity of the damage over time is indicated by the color of the rectangle.  
Equipping certain Armor and Accessories will increase the player's tolerance for extreme temperatures, increasing the temperature required to take damage and decreasing the damage taken in those temperatures. Additionally, some [Mounts](https://palworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Mounts) provide immunity to Heat, Cold, or both.   
## Inventory

Work Speed's base value is 100.  
The time it takes to preform a task is determined between an item's Work Load and the player's Work Speed. The higher the Work Load the longer it will take to complete a task. The higher a player's Work Speed the faster the player is at completing said task. (*See *[*Work Load*](https://palworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Work_Load)*)*
