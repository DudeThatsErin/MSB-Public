IGN Information  
**Palworld Tips and Tricks**  
When you first start playing Palworld, beyond a short tutorial that gets you set up with your first base, the game doesn’t reveal a lot of things to the player and expects you to figure it out on your own. Here's what you should know to make your Palworld adventures run more smoothly!  
  
**Check Your Pals' Work Suitability**  
  
![Image-43](Misc Information\MiscInformation_43.png)  
  
Pals can perform different jobs in your home base, including mining, chopping wood, and even making medicines, depending on their natural skillset. However, they can't perform tasks that they don't have the relevant skill to perform. Their [work suitability](https://www.ign.com/wikis/palworld/Pal_Traits) shows what kind of jobs they’re suitable for - at the beginning of the game, you'll definitely want Pals with Planting, Watering, Mining, Kindling, Lumbering, Transporting, and Farming skills.  
Check out our list of the [Best Pals for Your Base](https://www.ign.com/wikis/palworld/Best_Pals_for_Your_Base)!  
  
Farming skills mean that a Pal can be assigned to the Ranch, and will drop unique items depending on its species. This is a highly effective way to gather resources such as milk, honey, and wool.  
  
**Prepare for Base Raids**  
![Image-44](Misc Information\MiscInformation_44.png)  
  
Base Raids occur periodically, based on gameplay time. During a raid, a mob of enemies (either human or Pal) will appear and damage your base and Pals until you defeat them or the raid duration expires.  
  
Raids can include explosive or fire-type Pals, which will burn down any wooden structures you have. Be sure to start building in stone as soon as you can!  
Alarm Bells are one of the most important things in your base. With the power of this bell, you can direct your Pals to either focus on working or defending your base.  
  
**You Can Summon An Additional Pal To Work In Your Base**  
![Image-45](Misc Information\MiscInformation_45.png)  
  
If you want to get things done quicker in your base (and in the open world!) you can summon another pal to help you. Simply throw the Pal Sphere that contains the Pal inside somewhere that it can actually do work and it’ll start working. We have also found out that this is the best way to have a Pal stay on a job for a long time.  
  
**Catch 10 Pals of The Same Kind For Easy Leveling in Early Game**  
![Image-46](Misc Information\MiscInformation_46.png)  
  
As you further progress in the game, you’ll notice that it’s not really the [Pal](https://www.ign.com/wikis/palworld/Paldeck_-_Pals_List) levels that are holding you back, but it’s really your level. Pal levels are gated and cannot pass your character level which means that if you’re level 10, the max levels your Pals can get is only level 10.  
If your Pals are higher level than you, they get synced back down to your level. As such, you’re going to want to raise your level up quickly and the fastest to do that is by catching 10 of the same Pals.  
  
**Ores Are Very Important**  
![Image-47](Misc Information\MiscInformation_47.png)  
  
[Ores](https://www.ign.com/wikis/palworld/Palworld_Ore_Locations_and_Ore_Farm) appear similar to Stones as a big lump of solid matter growing on the ground. The difference between the two is that Ores have a slight yellow hue to them.  
While Ores doesn’t seem useful in the early game, when you approach the mid-game, you'll need a large amount of Ore. As such, it’s beneficial to either start your first base near a few Ore deposits or be ready to build a new base at Base Level 10 where you can [Automate your Ore](https://www.ign.com/wikis/palworld/How_to_Automate_Ore) Collection.  
  
**Explore at Night!**  
  
![Image-48](Misc Information\MiscInformation_48.png)  
  
Night exploration is one of the best things to do if you're looking to treasure hunt and unlock waypoints as they glow in the dark and are easier to spot. However, depending on where you're exploring, make sure to have the proper coat or armor to adjust to the temperature!  
  
**Stuck Pals in Base**  
  
![Image-49](Misc Information\MiscInformation_49.png)  
  
During your time in Palworld, you might notice that there might be Pals that show up as hungry even though you have your Feed Box at a very accessible place. This might happen due to them being stuck somewhere in your base such as the roof of your house or in weird spots.  
When you notice this, head to your Pal Box put the stuck Pal back to the reserves, and then put them back on the field. Once they're summoned, they should be free from being stuck and head to the Feed Box.  
  
*From \<[https://www.ign.com/wikis/palworld/Palworld_Tips_and_Tricks](https://www.ign.com/wikis/palworld/Palworld_Tips_and_Tricks)&gt;*  
**Things Palworld Doesn’t Tell You**  
Whether you're only just getting started in Palworld, or you've been exploring and catching Pals for quite some time already, the following tips and tricks are sure to make your adventures run more smoothly!  
  
**Carefully Assign Points When Leveling**  
When you level up, you can choose one of your stats to enhance permanently. Although increasing your stats is generally helpful, some of these stats offer far more value than others. The only known way to reset your stats is by taking Memory Wiping Medicine, crafted at level 43, and Palworld devs have stated that there’s a bug with this medicine currently and players should avoid consuming it. So the points you allocate are effectively permanent!  
- **HP:** HP is one of the most valuable stats to increase as it’ll help you stay alive longer.  
- **Stamina:** Stamina is useful in the early game when you don’t have a mount, but once you use a mount, it’s the mount's Stamina stat that becomes relevant instead.  
- **Attack:** Similar to Stamina, you’re most likely to be dealing damage using a Pal, so your Attack stat isn’t that relevant to your overall strength. You also don’t get much extra Attack when you level it up, so it’s not recommended.  
- **Work Speed:** Work Speed is helpful, but if you’re really efficient you’ll be getting Pals to do your work for you - and eventually you’ll get Pals who work faster than you ever could, so it’s not a valuable long term investment.  
- **Weight:** Weight is another very valuable stat to increase, allowing you to carry more heavy resources like ore and stone.  
  
![Image-50](Misc Information\MiscInformation_50.png)  
  
**Choose the Best Base Location**  
The spot you choose for your first base is incredibly important.  
Ensure the entire space around your Palbox is clear and can be built on easily. While landmarks and interesting terrain may be appealing visually, you will end up needing all your available space to place base modules and you don’t want anything getting in your way. Also, your Pals can get stuck pretty easily - see the image above - and they won’t be happy if they spend a whole day trapped somewhere not eating or sleeping.  
  
Note: You can’t build on water! Avoid including water in your base radius.  
  
However, you do want to **include as many harvestable resources like stone, wood, and ore as possible** in your base radius, as your Pals will be able to collect these for you automatically and they respawn every day. Including ore is particularly useful!  
  
![Image-51](Misc Information\MiscInformation_51.png)  
**Lay Out Your Base Efficiently**  
It’s most efficient to set up Food Pots close to where your Pals will be working, so they don’t waste time walking to and from the Food Pot when they’re hungry.  
Placing Chests next to production stations is also the most efficient option as it means Pals won’t waste time carrying resources across your base.  
You don’t need resources in your inventory to use them in crafting or building - as long as they’re in storage, you’ll use them automatically!  
  
**Catch 10 of Every Pal**  
You receive a huge chunk of experience the first 10 times you catch any Pal species. This is by far the fastest way to level up in Palworld, so you should catch as many Pals as you can until you hit 10/10 for every Pal.  
  
**Use the Back Bonus When Catching Pals**  
If you hit a Pal from behind with a Pal Sphere, your catch chance improves significantly. You can preview the catch % when aiming at the Pal’s back. It’s much easier to hit a Pal from behind when it’s sleeping, so if you explore at night, you can sneak up on and capture Pals that are significantly lower level than you.  
  
![Image-52](Misc Information\MiscInformation_52.png)  
  
**Vixy Drops Pal Spheres and Arrows at the Ranch**  
You can assign certain Pals to your Ranch at the base and they will produce relevant items for you - Mozzarina produces milk, and Chikipi produces eggs, for example. Vixy, however, digs up items for you - specifically, Pal Spheres and Arrows, both of which are incredibly useful early on.  
  
![Image-53](Misc Information\MiscInformation_53.png)  
  
**Condense Your Best Pals to Make Them Stronger**  
Since you’ll be catching 10 of every Pal, you’ll likely have loads of Pals of the same type filling up your Palbox - more than you could ever use. Once you’ve built your Pal Condenser, choose a Pal with the best passive skills from each species, and then use the weaker Pals as essences to upgrade it.  
Note that this does consume the Pals you use for essence.  
Upgrading your Pals in this way increases their base stats and the level of their Partner Skill, too.  
  
**You Can Revive Your Pals Instantly**  
You can revive a knocked-out Pal by putting it in your Palbox and waiting for 10 minutes, but there’s another way to revive one instantly - **place it in your party, and go to sleep in a bed at night-time**. When you wake up in the morning, it’ll be fully revived.
