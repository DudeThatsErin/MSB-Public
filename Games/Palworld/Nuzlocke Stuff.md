Nuzlocke Stuff  
Nuzlocke Rules  
>1. I can only catch and use 1 of each Pal and I can only use the first one I catch. If it dies, it cannot be replaced. Extra Pals can be caught for the purposes of XP / the condenser but otherwise unusable.  
>1. You have to name every first captured or hatched pal.  
>1. If a pal is K/o we have to butcher it.  
>1. I may catch one of each Shiny Pal independent of the non shiny versions. I cannot breed them.  
>1. I cannot fight without having a Pal summoned. I can briefly recall them during a fight to reposition it or change my active Pal. I can also dismiss my Pal when attempting to catch another.  
>1. If I die, I must choose a Pal to sacrifice from my active team.  
>1. I can sell Pals, but not buy them.  
>1. If I breed pals, I only get 3 chances (eggs) if I take another chance, then the previous egg is butchered.  
>1. Breeding is the ONLY way we can replace a previously caught pal. Ex. Breed for foxparks to replace first caught.
