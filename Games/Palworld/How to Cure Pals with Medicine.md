Luckily, there's a way to alleviate this with the use of medicine.

While some medicine can be looted from defeated Wild Pals, nothing beats being able to craft it with your materials whenever you need them. To craft a Medicine Bench,** you need to be level 12 **and have it **unlocked in the Technology tree**.  
  
After that, you need to gather...  
- 30x Wood  
- 5x Nail  
- 10x Paldium Fragments  
  
Once you've gathered all of the materials, you can craft the workbench in a space in your base!  
  
  
**Craft the Specific Medicine You Need**

Upon checking the Medicine Workbench's offering, you'll find that there's a variety of medicines that only cure specific types of status ailments. For sprains and colds, you have to craft Low-Grade Medical Supplies.  
  
To know what kind of ailments the medicine cures, hover your mouse over the specific medicine in the crafting window.

There are **two ways **to give your Pals the medicine you crafted or looted. It entirely depends on what they're currently doing.  
  
For **a worker in your base**, you have to approach them and press the interact button. A radial menu will pop up shortly after which will list the different things you can do to interact with your Pal.** Select Feed **and another window will pop up. **Select the medicine you want to give your Pal and they should approach you and take the medicine.**  
  
If the ailing Pal is **in your party**, select the medicine and then select the ailing Pal to feed them the medicine.
