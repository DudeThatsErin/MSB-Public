# How to Craft Polymer
**How to Craft Polymer**  
The only way of fulfilling your [Palworld](https://www.ign.com/wikis/palworld) dreams of battling pocket monsters with guns is to craft your own firearms but to do that, you’re going to need Polymer. This <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/palworld/Palworld_Technology_List_And_How_To_Unlock">craftable</a> resource is vital for creating everything from a Circuit Board to an Assault Rifle in Palworld. Follow our guide to learn how to craft it and what you’ll need to do to get it.  
  
**How to Unlock the Recipe for Polymer**  
  
The Polymer recipe becomes unlockable at Player Level 33 in the [Technology](https://www.ign.com/wikis/palworld/Palworld_Technology_List_And_How_To_Unlock) tab of the menu, and it costs 2 Technology Points to acquire. "Made from refined oil," the description reads. "Required for producing various advanced items such as rifles."

If you still haven't hit Level 33, then be sure to catch 10 of every Pal you encounter in the wild. You get an escalating XP bonus for every subsequent Pal that stops once you have 10. And you can check the progress of this in your Paldeck menu along with the habitat for each Pal. This is by far the most efficient means of leveling up. Increasing your level is also the most reliable way to collect Technology Points. Should you need more, reference [IGN's Palworld map](https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-interactive-map) and spend some time unlocking more fast travel points. Each time you unlock one, you'll get a Technology Point.

You'll need to also unlock and build a Production Assembly Line in order to actually craft Polymer. It costs three Technology Points at Level 28, so you theoretically should have it unlock even before you get to Polymer. The Production Assembly Line requires electricity and Pals with the Handiwork trait to run.

All you need to craft Polymer is some [High Quality Pal Oil](https://www.ign.com/wikis/palworld/How_to_Get_High_Quality_Pal_Oil), a resource that drops from the following Pals:  
- Woolipop (034)  
- Dumud (043)  
- Grintale (052)  
- Digtoise (067)  
- Flambelle (070)  
- Elphidran (080)  
- Relaxaurus (085)  
- Mammorest (090)  
- Quivern (095)

As is the case with most Pal-based resources, the most efficient way to farm High Quality Pal Oil is to catch a bunch of these Pals (don't defeat them in combat) and then butcher them using a Meat Cleaver. It's brutal and disturbing, but it does allow you to double dip on the loot. This way, you can asses the Pals you catch and sacrifice the ones with bad traits while keeping the once with [beneficial traits](https://www.ign.com/wikis/palworld/Pal_Traits).
