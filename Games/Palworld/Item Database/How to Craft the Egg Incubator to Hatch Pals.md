# How to Craft the Egg Incubator to Hatch Pals
**How to Craft the Egg Incubator to Hatch Pals**  
Much like the monster-catching classic franchise it borrows heavily from, [Palworld](https://www.ign.com/wikis/palworld) features a <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/palworld/How_to_Breed_Pals">breeding system</a> that confirms all Pals hatch from eggs whether they're birds, turtles, cats, or little puffs of smoke. Not only can you breed certain Pals together to gestate <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/palworld/Pal_Breeding_Combinations">unique combinations</a>, but there are numerous eggs you can discover out in the wild. The only way to hatch those eggs, however, is to craft and nurture an Egg Incubator of your own.  
  
Follow this guide to build your very own and start hatching some Pal Eggs.  
  
**How to Unlock and Craft an Egg Incubator**  
  
The Egg Incubator is one of the earliest pieces of Ancient Technology that you can unlock in Palword at Player Level 7 in the single column to the far right. It costs two [Ancient Technology Points](https://www.ign.com/wikis/palworld/How_to_Get_Ancient_Technology_Points) to unlock the recipe. To acquire those, you have to defeat bosses: there are the five tower bosses that function sort of like Pokémon gym leaders and also Alpha Pals that appear on the world map as a circular icon.

Once you've unlocked the recipe, you'll need to spend the following resources to craft a single Egg Incubator:  
- 10 Paldium Fragments  
- 5 Cloth  
- 30 Stone  
- 2 Ancient Civilization Parts  
  
Paldium Fragments and Stone can be mined even in the starting area, and Cloth can be refined from Wool using a Crafting Bench. You can sometimes find Ancient Civilization Parts in rare-tier chests, but the most straightforward way is to beat or capture Alpha Pals, Dungeon bosses, or Lucky Pals. Once you've got all the materials, just find a place in your camp to build it. Be sure to build it with plenty of space around it because the hatching process sometimes requires you to manipulate the environment a little bit. (More on that later.)  
  
**Pal Egg Types**

The various Pal Egg types correspond to the nine elements associated with different Pals. In every case, the designs and descriptions associated with each egg are pretty self-explanatory. Damp Eggs yield Water Pals, Scorching Eggs yield Fire, etc. They also come in different sizes that correspond with rarity, namely Regular, Large, and Huge.  
  
- Common Egg (Neutral)  
- Damp Egg (Water)  
- Dark Egg (Dark)  
- Dragon Egg (Dragon)  
- Electric Egg (Electric)  
- Frozen Egg (Ice)  
- Rocky Egg (Ground)  
- Scorching Egg (Fire)  
- Verdant Egg (Grass)  
  
**How to Get Pal Eggs**  
  
There are two ways to get Pal Eggs: You can breed two of your base's worker Pals using a Pal Breeding Farm or simply steal them from their nests in the wild.  
  
**Where to Find Pal Eggs**  
  
![Image-3](How to Craft the Egg Incubator to Hatch Pals\HowtoCrafttheEggIncubatortoHatchPals_3.png)  
  
There are a total of 205 Pal Eggs in various places around the Palpagos Islands, and we've listed each of them on [IGN's interactive Palworld map](https://www.ign.com/maps/palworld/palpagos-islands). Much like the Lifmunk Effigies or Treasure Chests, each egg is located in a fixed location, so if you know exactly where to look, you can find them all.  
  
**How to Breed**  
  
![Image-4](How to Craft the Egg Incubator to Hatch Pals\HowtoCrafttheEggIncubatortoHatchPals_4.png)  
  
The Pal Breeding Farm becomes unlockable at Level 19. All you need to do is place some Cake into the Breeding Farm Chest and then literally throw one male and one female Pal at the Breeding Farm. Each Pal has a hidden power level of a sort that determines the outcome of breeding, so consider using the player-made [Pal Breeding Calculator by Kimpton](https://palworld.kimpton.io/). The offspring of a union is essentially the average power of the parents, so the egg produced by an ultra-powerful Pal mated with a weak one will fall right in the middle.

**How to Use an Egg Incubator to Hatch Eggs**  
  
However you acquire your eggs, you'll need to place them inside the Egg Incubator that you've built one at a time. Larger eggs take longer to hatch, but in most cases, you can expedite the process a little bit depending on the needs of the egg.

The most common typically involve temperature. Scorching Eggs like it hot, so build a few campfires around it until it "seems very comfortable." You're looking for it to say "Incubation Speed +100%" so toy around with the nearby environment if you want to expedite the process.
