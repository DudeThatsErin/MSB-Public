# Egg Types & What Will Hatch

**All Palworld Egg Types and What Will Hatch**  
The easiest and best way to acquire some of the rarest Pals in [Palworld](https://www.ign.com/wikis/palworld) is to invest in the surprisingly nuanced <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/palworld/Pal_Breeding_Combinations">breeding system </a>— and to hunt down the various <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/palworld/How_to_Craft_the_Egg_Incubator_to_Hatch_Pals">eggs</a> you can discover in the wild. But what sort of Pals hatch from which kinds of eggs? Where can you find them? How can you breed Pals to generate the Pals you want to get for your team or base? Here's a guide covering all that and more.  
  
**Palworld Egg Types**  
  
Palworld features nine element types associated with every Pal in the game. Most of them use a single element but some do have two. When it comes to specific egg types, an egg's corresponding type is either totally obvious or fairly easy to figure out. Dark, Dragon, and Electric Pals hatch from Dark, Dragon, and Electric Eggs. But the other egg types require just a little bit of guesswork. Common Eggs hatch Neutral Pals, for instance. Here's a breakdown of all the egg types and what element they yield.

When it comes to finding eggs in the wild, the various types are typically found within the biomes or areas associated with their elements. Damp Eggs are always near water. Scorching Eggs are often near a volcano or desert. If you're specifically looking for wild eggs of a certain type, consider that on your hunt.

**Palworld Egg Rarities**  
  
**An egg's size is proportional to the rarity of the Pal that will hatch from it. **The three egg rarities, or sizes, are Regular, Large, and Huge.  
  
**What Pals Hatch From Each Rarity**  
  
It's important to distinguish between Pals you've stolen from their nests in the wild from the eggs generated in your Breeding Farm. The various Pal combinations you put into the Breeding Farm will always yield predictable results, but the eggs you discover out in the wild are less predictable. There are a fixed number of possibilities based on the egg type (which again corresponds to the element of the Pal).
