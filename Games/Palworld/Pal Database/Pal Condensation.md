# Condensation  
Pal Condensation is a way to make [Pals](https://palworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Pals) stronger by sacrificing Pals of the same species.   
The improved base Pal will show blue stars to indicate the finished process.  
Each star earned increases the Pal's [Partner Skill](https://palworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Partner_Skill) level by 1 (up to a maximum of level 5) and increase the Pal's base stats. At 4 stars, the Pal's <a href="https://palworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Working">Work Suitability</a> levels increase by 1.   
  
Any Pal that is sacrificed in the [Pal Essence Condenser](https://palworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Pal_Essence_Condenser) is lost, and neither its stats, nor <a href="https://palworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Passive_Skills">Passive Skills</a> are transferred to the base Pal.   
Pal Condensation is done through a built [Pal Essence Condenser](https://palworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Pal_Essence_Condenser).   
# Cost  
Each tier of pal condensation doubles in cost:  
In total, you will need 116 of the same species of Pal to achieve max rank.  
Pals that were previously ranked up will count as the total number of Pals it would've been separately, i.e. a rank 1 Pal will count as 5 sacrifices.  
Bear in mind that you cannot skip ranks, so sacrificing a rank 4 Pal to a rank 0 Pal will *not* rank it to 4, but only 1.
