Palworld's **Pal traits**, including Pal work suitability traits, Pal skills, and random Pal perks, determine which tasks your Pals can do for you. Whether your Pals stay at your Palworld base to gather materials or join you in battle, it’s very important to understand their strengths and weaknesses, so you'll choose the right Pal for the right task.  
This **Palword traits guide** will help you understand the different types of Pal traits and how to use them.  
## Pal Traits Explained  
[Each Palworld Pal](https://www.ign.com/wikis/palworld/Paldeck:_All_Pals) comes with individual stats and stats that belong to their species. If you select a Pal in the Paldeck, you will see a list of skills, stats, and other Pal traits. Here’s an overview of what they mean:   
>- **Partner skill**: a passive skill that belongs to the species. For example, a [Cattiva](https://www.ign.com/wikis/palworld/Cattiva)’s ‘Cat Helper’ Partner Skill increases the player’s maximum carrying capacity while in the party.   
>- **Work Suitability**: the highlighted skills determine which tasks this Pal may carry out (more on this below).  
>- **Food consumption**: determines how much the Pal eats.  
>- **Active skills**: active combat skills (attacks), determined by species. A low-level Pal only has one active skill, but a high-level Pal can have up to three active skills. New active skills are unlocked at level 5, 7, 15, 22, 30, 40, and 50.  
>- **Passive skills**: passive traits that influence the Pal’s work or combat abilities, in a good or in a bad way. Unlike the active skills, the passive skills are randomized and therefore different for each individual Pal. For example, a Pal with the ‘Runner’ trait has more movement speed, while a Pal with the ‘Coward’ trait deals less damage.  
  
## Pal Work Suitability  
Work suitability stats are the same for each member of the same species. If you place a Pal inside your base, it will automatically start working on tasks that match with its work suitability skills. For example, a [Lamball](https://www.ign.com/wikis/palworld/Lamball) will craft any unfinished items at your workstation for you, thanks to its 'handicraft' trait.

**How to Assign Pals to Work**  
You can expect to spend a lot of time putting together an efficient base in Palworld, and you'll rely on your Pals to work hard on your behalf while you're out exploring. While you can just drop Pals from your Palbox In your base and they'll get to work on a random task that suits their proficiencies, it's most efficient to manually assign your Pals to workstations to ensure they're used to their full potential.  
Wondering which Pals make the best base workers? Check out the [Best Pals for Your Base](https://www.ign.com/wikis/palworld/Best_Pals_for_Your_Base)!  
  
**Deploy Pals to Your Base**

To assign Pals to work on your base, simply head to your Pal Box and interact with it. A window should pop up on your screen which would show two segments. The top segment is your Pal Storage where the game stores your extra Pals and the bottom segment is where worker Pals are placed.  
  
Simply drag and drop a Pal from your Pal Storage or your party to one of the circles at the bottom part of the window to assign them to work in your base. Once this is done, the Pal should spawn right in front of you and start shuffling towards a work site in your base that they can work on.  
  
**Manually Assign Pals**  
  
But as mentioned above, there are times when you want your Pals to focus on a specific task. If you're interested in doing this, head over to one of your Pals and lift it. After that, head to the site you want them to focus on and throw them near it. There should be a notification that says they are now focusing on doing that specific task. One thing to note though that this acts more as a suggestion for the Pals and sometimes after a few minutes, they will start doing something else that interests them.

If you tried to lift and throw your Pal towards a specific site and it seems like they're not doing the job, you might want to check whether they're compatible with the job you're forcing them to do. Each site will have a notification on what kind of work suitability is needed for a Pal to operate it.  
  
Another way of ensuring that a Pal works on that site is by summoning a Pal from your party to do it. We've found that the summoned Pal typically stays on the job for longer compared to the ones summoned by the Pal Box.
