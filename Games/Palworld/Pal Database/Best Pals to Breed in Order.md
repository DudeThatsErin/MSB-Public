# Best Pals to Breed in Order
**Best Pals to Breed in Order**  
Many of the very best Pals in Palworld can only be found over level 45 at places like the various Wildlife Sanctuaries or the heart of a volcano, but if you’re a savvy breeder, you can get them far earlier than usual. Follow our guide to the best Pals to breed in order to do just that.  
  
**Breeding Basics**  
To get started breeding, you’ll have to first reach level 19 which is when you can unlock the recipe for a Breeding Farm in the Technology tab of the menu. To build it, you’ll need 100 wood, 200 stone, and 50 fiber. You’ll also need to build a Cooking Pot so you can unlock the recipe for and start cooking some Cake (5 Flour, 8 Red Berries, 7 Milk, 8 Eggs, 2 Honey).  
  
Once the Breeding Farm is built (and it takes up a lot of space), you assign two Pals to the Breeding Farm and then put one Cake in the breeding feed box for every egg you want the pair to produce.

Fire | - Kindling (lvl. 2) | 
  
  
**061 - Kitsun**  
  
Arguably one of the single best mounts in the game, Kitsun is a large Fire-type fox that renders its rider unaffected by the cold or heat. And since it’s incredibly rare in the wild, breeding it is your best option. Better yet, you can do it as soon as you unlock the Breeding Farm.

| **Gumoss** |  | **Sweepa** | 
  
Gumoss frequent the forests near the starting area and just beyond. (They look like a silly puddle of sentient mud with a leaf on its head.) But there’s also a level 11 Alpha Pal version in the Sea Breeze Archipelago. As for Sweepa, the Alpha Pal version of this large white fluff ball with a mustache is in the Small Cove Island and also only level 11. Get them early on and make this your first breeding experiment.

| **Rooby** |  | **Penking** | 
  
For an alternate combo, go with Rooby (another fire fox) and Penking. Directly northwest of the starting area, there’s a level 15 Penking Alpha Pal northeast of the Abandoned Mineshaft. They look like a large blue penguin king. Rooby can be found on Marsh Island directly north of the starting area.  
  
**Rayhound**

Electric | - Generating electricity (lvl. 2) | 
  
  
**060 - Rayhound**  
  
Like Kitsun, Rayhound is an excellent mount but for different reasons. It can double-jump, and many of its mounted attacks involve firing straightforward projectiles that are easy to aim. As an Electric-type, it can also be used to power your base later on, but it’s also quite useful for breeding purposes (more on that later).

| **Penking** |  | **Caprity** | 
  
We suggest going this route for Rayhound as it is the most straightforward. Penking spawns as a level 15 Alpha Pal northeast of the Abandoned Mineshaft in the Windswept Hills northwest of the starting area. Caprity, while a bit uncommon, also spawns in that same area usually between level 10 and 15.

| **Direhowl** |  | **Nitewing** | 
  
  
Direhowls are a solid Neutral-type fighter in the early game worth catching in any scenario. They’ll sometimes attack your starting base, but they can also be caught at level 10 or under on Eastern Wild Island, Marsh Island, and the western edge of Windswept Hills. Nitewing spawns in various places, including the starting area, around level 10. But there’s also a level 18 Alpha Pal on the southern tip of Ice Wind Island.

| **Direhowl** |  | **Sweepa** | 
  
Refer to the above entry for details on Direhowl, but Sweepa is a low-level Ice-type that’s easiest caught in its Alpha Pal form on the western island in the Sea Breeze Archipelago.  
  
**Quivern**

[**095 - Quivern**](https://www.ign.com/wikis/palworld/Quivern) | ![Image-17](Best Pals to Breed in Order\BestPalstoBreedinOrder_17.png)  
Dragon | - Handiwork  
- Gathering (lvl. 2)  
- Mining (lvl. 2)  
- Transporting (lvl. 3) | 
  
  
**095 - Quivern**  
  
It’s not too challenging to catch a Quivern outright at the Sealed Realm of the Winged Tyrant checkpoint. The blue teleportation platform transport you directly into a fight with it at level 23. You can also catch one in the wild at the No. 2 Wildlife Sanctuary to the west but at a much higher level. However, you can skip all of that and breed one potentially right when you unlock the Breeding Farm. It’s a solid Dragon type and beats out Nitewing as an early-game flying mount.

| **Nitewing** |  | **Relaxaurus** | 
  
Nitewing rarely spawns in the skies almost all over the map, including the starting area around level 11. But if you’ve made it to level 18, you can head to the southern tip of Ice Wind Island to battle the Alpha Pal version. Nitewing is already a must-catch because it’s the earliest flying mount available, so you might as well use it to get an even better mount.  
Relaxaurus can be caught between level 10 and 20 just southwest of the map’s center in the Ascetic Falls and Sealed Realm of the Thunder Dragon. Breed these two, and you’ve got a Quivern. Not only is it a solid mount and an excellent fighter, but it’s also great for breeding future Pals.  
**Anubis**

[**100 - Anubis**](https://www.ign.com/wikis/palworld/Anubis) | ![Image-21](Best Pals to Breed in Order\BestPalstoBreedinOrder_21.png)  
Ground | - Handiwork (lvl. 4)  
- Mining (lvl. 3)  
- Transporting (lvl. 2) | 
  
  
**100 - Anubis**  
Perhaps the most coveted non-legendary Pal, the Ground-type Anubis spawns at level 47 as an Alpha Pal in the Twilight Dunes, but it’s possible to acquire one far earlier with a variety of breeding combos. It wields some incredibly powerful attacks and is easily the best Ground Pal in the game.

| **Quivern** |  | **Chillet** | 
  
  
Either breed a Quivern or catch its Alpha Pal version at level 23, and catch a level 11 Chillet Alpha Boss south of the Fort Ruins fast travel point. In theory, you could pull this off pretty much right after you build a Breeding Farm if you breed a Quivern first. And Chillet is an excellent Pal all-around, so you really should get one regardless.

| **Bushi** |  | **Penking** | 
  
Bushi are normally above level 30 as they roam the volcanos of the Palpagos Islands, but there’s a level 23 Alpha Pal in the Sealed Realm of the Swordmaster (-131, -493). A level 15 Penking Alpha Pal also hangs out northeast of the Abandoned Mineshaft in the redwood forest northwest of the starting area.

| **Ragnahawk** |  | **Tombat** | 
  
If your player level is already in the 30s, then you’re far better off going this route as Ragnahawk is one of the best flying mounts in the game. Find them around level 35 in the southwest corner of the map around the Mount Obsidian volcano.  
  
Tombat spawn at night in the Windswept Hills northwest of the starting area. Focus on the southern edge of the red area of the map.  
  
While we’ve provided what we consider the best and easiest combos that work for Anubis, players have also reported the following combos working:  
  
- Dinossum Rex + Warsect  
- Bushi + Grintale  
- Vanwyrm + Azurobe  
- Arsox + Pyrin  
- Caprity + Beakon  
- Eikthyrdeer + Beakon  
- Incineram + Surfent  
- Mossanda + Katress  
- Nitewing + Rayhound
