dg-permalink: ts3-ts4/100baby
dg-path: The Sims/100 Baby Challenge
---
This has been adapted since (at least) the Sims 2 days. I am creating my own rules for this that follow the gist of the original rules. This is how I usually play the game.

Since I never really tend to follow rules myself and only use them as guidelines, that is what I am going to provide here.

### Guidelines:
1. Make a female heir. Doesn’t matter what she looks like. Use whatever traits and likes/dislikes. Even CC ones work. Just know if the game is _too_ easy, this challenge is not fun.
2. Move her in anywhere. I like to use an empty lot and build a Tiny Home (from the Tiny Home pack) and use that for as long as possible. You can do whatever and even use `freerealestate` cheat.
3. Use what money you have to build a home.
4. Start Playing!
5. Turn aging on or off… doesn’t matter. I keep it off.
6. Hiring NPCs is allowed. Any NPCs.
7. Have babies with anyone. The father’s (or mother’s) can only be used once. I tend to kill them after (cause it is fun watching them suffer) but you can do what you please.
8. Try to have 100 babies.

### Newborn -> Infant Age Up Guidelines:

If you have aging turned off, follow these guidelines:

1. Age up your newborn after 1 Sim-Week.
2. Your matriarch must stay home when they have newborns.

### Infant -> Toddler Age Up Guidelines:
1. If you have the Growing Together Expansion Pack: Do tummy time as much as possible. You want to get 3 milestones in each category except Social Milestones.
2. If you don’t have the EP: Age up infants after 3 Sim-Weeks.
3. Your matriarch must stay home when they have infants.

### Toddler -> Child Age Up Guidelines:

1. Your toddler must have level 3 in 3 skills to age up. Can be any 3 skills. I recommend:
    1. Imagination (super easy with the tent)
    2. Movement (super easy using the slide)
    3. Thinking (super easy if you have the infant watch someone else)

### Child -> Teen Age Up Guidelines:

1. Your child must have an A in school.
2. If you have the Parenthood Game Pack: Your child must have 1 [character value](https://www.carls-sims-4-guide.com/gamepacks/parenthood/values.php) in line for them to earn when they age up.
    1. I recommend joining scouts, this helps with the character values drastically.
3. Your child must have level 10 in 1 skill.
    1. I find mental easiest as children can use the meditation stools which has them gain the skill quick plus the child can just sit there for hours while you are playing with the other members of your household.

### Teen -> Young Adult Age Up Guidelines:

1. Your teen must have an A in school
2. If you have the Parenthood Game Pack: Your teen must have 2 character values in line for them to earn when they age up.
    1. This is why I recommend scouts.
3. Your teen must have level 10 in 1 skill.
    1. I recommend logic for the same reason as mental for children.

### Young Adult Guidelines:

Once your child is a YA, they must be moved out. You can use McCommand Center to do this or use the built-in tools. Doesn’t matter. They just have to be moved out on the day that they age up to a YA.

### FAQs

1. Do occult sim babies count as 1 or 2 babies?
    1. They count as 2.
2. What do I do if I have aging on and my matriarch is an elder and can no longer bear children?
    1. Same as the original rules. Her youngest daughter must take over.
3. Can I use mods or CC that give me an advantage?
    1. If that would make this fun for you, sure!
4. Can I move dead sims who turned into ghosts back into the household?
    1. Sure!
5. Can I save a sim from death or bring a sim back to life?
    1. Sure!
6. Can my matriarch have a job?
    1. If you have Dream Home Decorator Game Pack: Your matriarch can be a decorator, freelancer, or anything that rarely requires your sim to leave the home.
    2. If you don’t, your sim must just be a freelancer that rarely requires her to leave the home.
7. What happens if my child gets taken by in-game CPS? Do they still count?
    1. Unfortunately no. Only children that have aged from newborn -> YA count.
8. Can I influence the gender of my babies?
    1. Sure! It is hard to keep track of what does that anyway.
9. Can I pick my child’s traits?
    1. Sure!
10. Can I own a pet?
    1. Yes, just know that will make this challenge harder as you will have 1 less household slot.
11. Can I expand the number of people in my household with cheats?
    1. Sure. Just remember you can’t go into CAS with more than 8 sims otherwise sims with disappear into the abyss.
12. Can I wish for a child from the wishing well?
    1. Sure! & Yes, they do count.
13. Can I use a science baby?
    1. Sure! & Yes they do count.

Even though this makes it more fun for me, the highest I can go with my ADHD is 30 children total. What about you?
