Just like my other challenges, I will be linking the [original rules](https://lithiarch.weebly.com/the-super-sim-challenge.html) and using guidelines in my challenges.

## Super Sim Tracker
James Turner created the <a href="https://jamesturner.yt/supersim/tracker" target="_blank">Super Sim Tracker</a> which you can use to track your progress in the Super Sim Challenge. I **highly** recommend using it. It makes it incredibly easy to track your progress.

### Guidelines:
- Create 1 Young Adult sim with any skills, any CC or in-game traits and any likes/dislikes OR use an existing sim from a previous challenge.
    - Using a previous sim makes it easier cause if you play the 100 baby challenge then your child sims will already have 2 skills to level 10 (according to my guidelines) and have 2 positive or negative character values. It makes this challenge that much easier.
- Aging can be off or on. On makes the game more challenging.
- Mods & CC are perfectly okay.
- Cheats & exploiting known bugs for sim’s gain is perfectly okay.

### Goals:

- Achieve highest promotion in all Careers (for branched careers, complete at least one branch).
- Max all skills.
- Complete all aspirations.
- Buy all Reward Traits.

Only way you can lose is if your sim dies before finishing this challenge.
