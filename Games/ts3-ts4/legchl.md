title: The Sims 3 or 4 Legacy Challenge
dg-permalink: ts3-ts4/legacy
dg-path: The Sims/Legacy Challenge
---
This is a basic challenge where the goal is to start at zero simoleons and raise 10 generations of sims any way you like. [You can view the original rules here](https://simslegacychallenge.com/the-sims-4-legacy-challenge-rules/). Just like my [100 Baby Challenge](https://wiki.dudethatserin.com/index.php/docs/the-sims-3-4/100-baby-challenge/), I’m just going to be using guidelines here.

### Getting Started Guidelines:

- Create 1 or 2 sims in CAS. They can be a couple or not.
- You can start on any size lot. You can move around during any of the generations as well.
- If you have Seasons: Start in Winter.
- Cheat sims money to zero by using “testingcheatsenabled true” & “money 0” in-game. If you don’t know how to use cheats, check [this article](https://www.alphr.com/how-to-enable-cheats-in-sims-4/).
- Just start playing.

I’m not one to follow rules for game challenges so I don’t have many for my Legacy Challenge. It is more of a “Rags to Riches” challenge than a Legacy Challenge for me.
