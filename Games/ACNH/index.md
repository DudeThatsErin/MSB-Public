# Useful Links
These are all of the links I use that I want to provide to everyone else.

<a href="https://turnip.exchange" target="_blank">Turnip Exchange</a>- This is how I make millions of bells using the Turnip Market.

<a href="https://turnipprophet.io" target="_blank">Turnip Prophet</a>- This is a good way to figure out when the best time to sell turnips on your own island.

<a href="https://catalogue.ac" target="_blank">Catalogue</a>- This is one of the best places to store your progress in AC. I use it for my island.

<a href="https://ac-browser.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/acnh_fish_radar.html" target="_blank">AC Fish Finder</a>- This is one of the best ways to figure out the best time to catch any fish in the game. I used this to figure out when to catch a Coelacanth.
