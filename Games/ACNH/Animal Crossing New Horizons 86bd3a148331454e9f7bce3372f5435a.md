üí° You can click on the images in any page (including this one) to enlarge the image so you can see it better.

Everything here is also fully searchable by using the üîç¬†icon in the top right corner of the page!
**********Note: The images are an exception, that is why I tried to put in as much typed stuff as possible.**********

Also, if any embed looks off, change from dark mode to light mode and it will go back to normal. The way you do that is with `CTRL + SHIFT + L` on Windows or `CMD + SHIFT + L` on Mac. You can change light mode to dark mode or vice versa with that keyboard shortcut. Works on any Notion page!

# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

## What app do you use to keep track of your island(s)?

### iOS, iPad, and Macbook Apps

- There is also Planner for ACNH. It is also built for iPad and iPhone first ***but*** it is resizable on Mac and the text isn‚Äôt too terribly small on Mac. You can also see your island‚Äôs weather in the app, which isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôve seen in any other app. So if you get your weather seed (read below about that) you can see your island‚Äôs weather. Honestly, this is my top recommendation.
    
    [‚ÄéPlanner for AC: NH](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/planner-for-ac-nh/id1499309768)
    
- I use Travel Guide which is available as a paid app on the iOS App Store for $3.99. It works on my iPad, iPhone and Macbook. Though it is made for an iPhone first so on an iPad and Macbook, the entire app will be small. I work around this by using Stage Manager on my iPad (which is able to make it a bit bigger) and full screen mode on my Macbook which makes it A LOT bigger. Travel Guide allows for multiple islands, so if you have more than 1 switch and more than 1 island, you can track them all in this one app.

[‚ÄéACNH Travel Guide](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/acnh-travel-guide/id1502818559)

- Another good app is ACNH.Guide on the iOS App Store. It is Free and designed for iPad and iPhone. So while you can download it on a Macbook and use it, the text is ****very**** small. So if you are looking for something that works on all 3, I don‚Äôt recommend ACNH.Guide. ACNH.Guide also only allows for 1 island.

[‚ÄéACNH.Guide for Animal Crossing](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/acnh-guide-for-animal-crossing/id1504317399)

### Android Apps

- Most recommended app is ACNH Pocket Guide. It is free to download and includes TONS of features that a lot of the apps on iOS do not have. For example, when you view creatures you get a preview of what the fish shadow looks like and time of day and the way the time of day is represented, is unique. It is also built to look like an iOS app.

[ACNH Pocket Guide - Apps on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.acnh.pocket_guide&hl=en_US&gl=US&pli=1)

- ACNH.Guide is also cross platform. Meaning, it works on Android & iOS. Everything I said above applies to here as well.

## How do I get more villagers to move to my island?

- Villagers will move in naturally over time, but you can also use Nook Miles Tickets to visit other islands and invite villagers to move to your island.

You can also check out the following page for more move-in information:

## Can I visit other players‚Äô islands? What if I am having issues visiting other islands?

- Yes, you can visit other players' islands by using Dodo Codes or by becoming friends through Nintendo Switch Online.

## **What is the best way to make money in Animal Crossing: New Horizons?**

- Money can be made through activities like fishing, bug catching, fossil hunting, and selling items. Some players also invest in the stock market (Stalk Market) by buying and selling turnips.

Dagnel has a great way on how to get rich quick in ACNH:

## **What are the turnips for, and how do I make a profit from them?**

- Turnips can be bought from Daisy Mae on Sundays. Players can sell turnips to Timmy and Tommy at Nook's Cranny at different prices during the week, aiming to make a profit.

koramora has a great video on turnips!

## **How do I upgrade my house?**

- You can upgrade your house by speaking to Tom Nook in the Resident Services building. He will offer house expansions and renovations as you progress in the game.

## What is the fishing tourney? / What is the bug tourney?

If your villagers are talking about a "big thing" coming up, that means we are close to either a fishing tournament or a bug-off event! 

<aside>
üí° CJ and Flick will let you know when you've reached a trophy milestone and you will receive it in the mail the following day.

</aside>

**Points obtained are cumulative throughout every tourney or bug off event.**

**Exchanging points for exclusive items does not affect your point milestone towards the trophy.** So feel free to exchange them for items.

**The prizes/items stay the same for every event.** They do not change.

**Visitors can sell to Flick/CJ during tourneys.**

## How do I replace a villager‚Äôs clothing or furniture?

- **Replacing Clothing**
    - Villagers' gifted clothing can be removed by complaining to Isabelle about the way they dress when they actually wear the clothing item in question (note that she will remove all items currently worn by the villager).
- **Replacing Furniture**
    - Villagers have the option to invite you to visit their house when you are at a high enough friendship level. During this visit, they'll eventually propose you to buy one of their displayed items. Doing so will remove the item from their house.
    - Owners of the Happy Home Paradise also have the option to directly customize villagers' houses after completion of the main part of the DLC. This also unlocks the option to reset the houses to their default layout via Isabelle.
    - Otherwise, refer to this guide for furniture replacement information:

Yes there are, check the image below for what you get.

## I got access to Happy Home Paradise via the Nintendo Switch Online Bundle, do I keep it if I cancel my Switch Online?

If you are using a Nintendo Switch Online + subscription to play Happy Home Paradise, once you lose access to your Nintendo Switch Online + subscription, you will lose access to the Happy Home Paradise archipelago, however the techniques that you unlocked for use on your own home will still be available!

## How do I get more reactions?

![reactions.png](Animal%20Crossing%20New%20Horizons%2086bd3a148331454e9f7bce3372f5435a/reactions.png)

## I want to restart my island, how do I do that? / Can I change my island name? / Can I change my character‚Äôs name?

No, you cannot change your island or character name regardless of whether they are the island representative or not. The only way to do that is to reset your island. This would be how you restart your island as well.

1. Go to the Home page on your Nintendo Switch.
2. Scroll over and go into your  System Settings. ‚öôÔ∏è
3. Scroll down to Data Management and select Delete Save Data.
4. Scroll to Animal Crossing: New Horizons and select it, and then select Delete All Save Data for This Software.

<aside>
‚ùó **Do NOT select Software > Delete Software. This will delete your game!**

Now when you start your game, you will be at the airport with the nook twins. As long as you don‚Äôt get to the part where your island is in real time you can keep quitting and restarting the game to get different islands, starter villagers, fruits and flowers.

## How do I get photos from my villagers?

Framed photos cannot be re-ordered from the catalog unlike posters. 

They can only be obtained via high level friendship (Level 5+) with the villager.

Yes, there is a 10 day cooldown after getting one photo where you can't get it from that villager again. 

**My friendship level is definitely Lv5+ but the villager did not give me their photo, why?**

RNG. It is random chance to receive a photo after gifting them, it's not guaranteed. 

**How do I get the different frames of the photo?**

Use a customization kit; it only costs 1 kit.
