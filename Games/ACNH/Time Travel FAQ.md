## Time Travel General Information
- Time travel will never remove items or progress!

- You can join someone's island even if they have time traveled.

- The time on your island will not affect others, nor will theirs affect you in any way.

- TT will not make villagers leave, nor affect their friendship

- Visitors will remain on set days unless you leave the current week*.

Forward:
- Using TT to go to the next day is exactly the same as doing so naturally.

- Negative effects of TT: Weeds & flowers will grow, cockroaches may be in your house, you may get the bedhead animation, villagers may ask where you've been. If you have a villager moving in/out or have turnips please see the faq. Any open plot may be filled upon going to a new day.

Backward:
- Positive Effects: The daily recipe bottle will respawn, fossils will respawn and visitor shops & Able Sister's daily stock will refresh.

- Neutral Effects: It will not count as a new "day" in terms of progression. Villagers will not advance moving out. Building construction/upgrades/moving will not be completed. Nook's shop WILL NOT refresh unless you are passed the current week*. Rocks will not refresh. Trees will not drop new furniture.

- Negative effects: Any open plot will be randomly filled with a new villager. Turnips will spoil. Watered effect will be removed from flowers and they will not grow.

*Current week is set on Monday @ 5:00AM. Current day is set at 5:00AM*
## Time Travel & Turnips
- Turnips on your island will spoil if the time on your island advances passed Sunday @ 5:00AM

- Turnips on your island will spoil if the time is changed backwards by any amount.

- Turnips will spoil on the ground, in your inventory, or anywhere else on the island.

- The time on an island you visit will not affect your turnips.

- Turnip buy and sell price is not locked! If you time travel back the prices WILL change.

- TT backwards will reset your price trend.
