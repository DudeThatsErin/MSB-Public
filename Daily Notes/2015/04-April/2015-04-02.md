HI!

So, I have been feeling depressed since my last session with my therapist. Since then some pretty awesome stuff has happened & I was happy for a bit during & afterwards but every night since my last therapy visit I've been depressed and thinking about Tessie. =[ ]=

I haven't really been following what my nutritionist or my therapist said I should do. My therapist told me to read my "Personal Bill of Rights" to myself out loud in a mirror OR @ least choose 2 or 3 to read every day. The ones that mean the most to me are numbers 4, 5, 7, 11, 15, 16, 20, 21, 23, 24 & 25. That's a lot but I’m hopeful I can be happier.

It is 10:36pm right now. I had to wait cause Kaitlyn came in here. I'm not ready to show her this. It is the act & not what is in here that I don't want to do. After talking to Kaitlyn I don't think I'm that bad. I guess the therapist was unknowingly (or knowingly, not sure) putting things into my head.

I moved my dorm bed today from right under the window to directly across from my TV. I wanted to be closer to my fish tank. I like looking in there and watching Jill & my pleco. She is always so happy to see me watching her. She is like a dog. I like it since I can't have dogs or cats in the dorm. I can't wait to move out. I just miss the animals being around me & being happy to see me. (:

Anyway, I'm tired. I’m done. Bye(:
