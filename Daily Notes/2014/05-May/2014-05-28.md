Hello,

So "Trip" blocked me. I quoted it because it was really his fiance because she feels threatened by me because he used to have a crush on me. At first, this upset me but now that I realize that our friendship was a sham I am going to LOL so hard when he eventually texts me. Then ask if he dumped Jessica. Hehe(: He will be confused but it makes sense if you think about it.

I am in Jacksonville alone tonight because I am going to see an advisor tomorrow. I need to get an osprey card, student ID, and see if I can register for classes. I need to be registered before my birthday so I can keep my health insurance.

Iam very tired right now so I am going to sleep since I have to wake up @ 7 so I can eat breakfast and leave by 7:30. I want to make sure I get to the advisor's office early or @ least on time since I don't know where it is on campus.

Time to sleep! Bye!
