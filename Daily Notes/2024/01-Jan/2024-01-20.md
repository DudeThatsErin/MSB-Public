3:15pm: I woke up with Josh around 9-ish and we have been playing Palworld all day. Stopped to eat but now we are going back. This is amazing. We are obsessed with this game.

12:40pm 1/22: We were playing all day and the next day. I got burnt out so I am taking today off. Nothing else happened besides me starting my period today.
