Writing out so it is easier to find in Obs.

Hello,

Just writing what I am grateful for today. This is something I want to start doing.
1. My health -> I am relatively healthy. I wish I were healthier but I am getting there.
2. My husband -> No matter how much Josh annoys me, I love him and appreciate everything he does for me.
3. My Job -> I appreciate how much they pay me and how lenient they are.
4. My Extended Family -> I appreciate everything they do for me. They love us and I love them. They are amazing.
That's all I can think of for now. I'll add more later if I can think of anything. ❤
