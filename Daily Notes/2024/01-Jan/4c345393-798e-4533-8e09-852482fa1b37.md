11am: Well, my note from yesterday disappeared. That is upsetting but meh.

Still working on the header on the b2b site but I am trying to finish it today so I can move onto the footer tomorrow and sunday. Was hoping to have everything done by Sunday but it doesn't look like that is possible. oh well. Anyway, time to go back to work.

12:30pm: It is later now. I finally got a perfect setup. I am planning on writing up a blog but I haven't decided if I am going to use Obsidian Digital Garden for that and if I do if I want separate sites for my \[\[Games/Home|Games\]\] and Blog or have them all in one place. Just something to think about.

3:42: Finished the header and as you can see below got my capture cut shortcut to work :D I also found [[2024-01-18]] on my iPhone and was able to get it back via Git. Boy do I love git in this situation. ‚ù§Ô∏è I'm becoming obsessed with Obsidian now that I finally have it set up the way I like it. Btw, I decided against Make.md which caused wayyyy too many problems so now this is how it looks... !\[\[updated-dark-mode.png\]\]

## Current plugins installed and such.

Easiest to share the debug info from obsidian since it shares my theme and all of the plugins I have plus my OS which is MacOS Sanoma.

5:07pm: I removed all of the styles from my Footer.vue file and that fixed 100% of my styling issues. WOO! I added the vue-slick-slider and besides the temporary issues I listed in the \[\[Header & Footer#^1491f1|Footer Section\]\] that I'm attempting to fix already, everything is FINALLY done with the header and footer. WOO HOO! FUCKING FINALLY AND I GET THE WEEKEND OFF.

I'm going to attempt to finish the home page product cards, too. But I am only working today. I'm not doing anything this weekend. I've done enough.

9pm: I thought I was pregnant today so I took a test and it was negative. üò¶ I'm sad about it but it is okay. I just should have started my period today. Oh well. Palworld just went into early access today and it looks REALLY good. Trying to install it now to test it.

11:30pm: Tested it with Josh and it is really fun. Well I‚Äôm going to sleep now, good night!!
