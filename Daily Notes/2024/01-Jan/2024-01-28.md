# Journal
8:20pm: So last night was *insane*. I was an **idiot** and tried to ask for 2 weeks off and I'm barely 60 days into this job. I'm around the 50 day mark. Am I trying to get ==fired==? Luckily, I just said it was for personal issues so I retracted it and said they got resolved and I will be in tomorrow AM.
I'm just not looking forward to it. 1- because I did that and 2- because I am still so burnt out. I **hate** driving there and back. It is SO LONG and my car SUCKS. Then I have to mask while I'm there and it gets tiring after a while. Part of me just wants to stop masking but I don't know how. It is something I have to learn.

I also need to learn to manage my time better. I have noticed since I switched to Things 3 when I started this job that I have been feeling overwhelmed since then. Heather says it could be grief due to my grandmother dying on November 23, 2023 but I'm not so sure about that. It was expected that she would pass away soon because her health was going downhill fast. She wasn't eating for the last month and she wasn't walking either.

I am still sad about it, don't get me wrong. I miss her every. single. day. I'm just not grieving.  Just look at the picture below.

I was in denial before it happened. I think I skipped over anger completely because there is no one to be angry with and I know that. Also, no one to bargain with so I skipped that. I was depressed after it happened for a bit but only for about a week and then everything was fine.

I've accepted she is gone and never coming back. The funeral was odd though. She looked like she was sleeping. I was expecting her to wake up and start yelling at us or something ü§£ 

I mean maybe I am still grieving and that's why I am so overwhelmed lately and can't seem to focus. It would explain a lot.
Either way, I can't go asking for 2 weeks off randomly, last minute, like that. It looks really bad and I know better. I'm still mad at myself for doing that.

I thought about taking these journals and everything and putting it back in OneNote but I can't deal with Microsoft potentially seeing my files and since these are just local on my device.

I just realized that either way I am giving Microsoft access to my notes.
> I can either use OneNote and lock my notes so I can feel like Microsoft can't see them (I think they can if they wanted to...) or I can use Obsidian and sync with github... which is owned my Microsoft and has basically "unlocked" notes (via a private repo) that Microsoft can see if they wanted to.

Sent that in the Obsidian discord server. Interesting. I may just start using OneNote again so I can *feel* more secure with my notes. I will miss this nice look of my vault but at least I get free syncing between devices and handwriting is built in and I can handwrite anywhere. Plus, I don't have to go over my "obsidian setup" on App Seeker because I will get the inevitable questions about it if I share my vault.
I still plan to participate in the Obsidian discord server and everything.

This is the last journal I will be writing in Obsidian though. At least for now. Bye Bye Obsidian!

Written later:
I'm not sure now.

You can see it seems like Obsidian is the best choice for me. So I think I am going to stick with it. I really like it. I just don't like how hard it is to sync between devices.

I'll have to figure out what I need synced between devices and set it up that way. I think I will just use the `.obsidian` directory and sync everything there. Annoying but it works.

Anyway, I have to go to sleep now. It is 9:45 and I have to be up at 7. I was going to wake up at 5:30a but I can't do that after sleeping like crazy like I was.

‚ù§Ô∏è Peace & Love!
