Writing it out so that it is easily searchable in Obsidian.

Hello,

Josh found out about my app addiction today because it got so bad this past month that before refunds I spent $400 on the amazon card. I've since requested refunds & uninstalled everything that wasn't free. I just hate how upset I am right now. Why even?

Let's go over the apps I use:
- Obsidian: Is Free. I can sync via GitHub for free and I did that for months and I was fine. So I don't get to use what is built in. So, what? I can & will live.
- Notion: Wasn't ever going to pay for that anyway.
- Arc: Free
- Things 3: I can either get over it or hope that my refunds get denied.
	- If they don't though I will have to get over it.

Alternatives:
- ~~Todoist~~ subscription = no go
- Microsoft To Do + Apple Reminders
	- Would have to get used to doing things very differently.

For now, I will adjust to using Apple Reminders.

My new setup:
- Obsidian
	- Obsidian Git -> my hosting (as private as possible)
	- Working Copy ^^ (if possible)
	- Backup to external SSD & run from there on desktops.
- Notion: stays the same.
- Apple Reminders, unless Things 3 is unable to be refunded.
- Mail app instead of Spark (spark was annoying anyway)
- Weather app instead of CARROT weather.

I need to get my impulses under control once & for all. I can't do this anymore. I am ruining my marriage and my life.

Good to know that Apple notes issue from my old iPad wasn't an iPad thing so I wasted $1600 on this new one. It is nice but I do regret getting it instead of an M1 or M2 Macbook. Oh well. @ least I can use this as a way to replace my iPad & buy applecare in a few months if JOsh is okay with that.

Damn the lag is SOOOO bad.

I'm gonna be done for now. We are getting Chipotle then I need to set up my mail apps & Obsidian vault.

ðŸ’—Peace & Love
