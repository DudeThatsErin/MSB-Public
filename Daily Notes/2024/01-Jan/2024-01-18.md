# Journal
Set up my obsidian vault. Decided to use the daily note as a place to jot down everything, it will be a mix of my journal as well as quick notes from my deskop, iPad, and iPhone. I just have to get shortcuts working. This is how it looks in light mode...

All of my projects for work are currently here and are set up in current settings.
