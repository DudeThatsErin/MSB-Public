8pm: Well, I got a bit accomplished today at work. Not much in reality though. I finished the header and started the footer and did some troubleshooting with it. I was overwhelmed most of the day and couldn't work on the footer though. I think I am also getting burnt out which SUCKS. Like, I can't get burnt out, that is not good AT ALL.
I don't really have much to say and don't feel like being on my macbook anymore so I'm going to commit this and watch some youtube videos. I am very tired today.
Talk to y'all tomorrow. ❤️
