# Journal
12:31pm: I'm feeling pretty good. Started my period on Saturday night and yesterday my bleeding was SO BAD.
Up until today at work my blood was insane. I took a shower and was cramping during it and my blood has been SOOO WATERY this month. So, yes, it hit my underwear and my legs. I dropped a clot on the bathroom floor last night. It was crazy. I felt awful last night as well. I am not sure if it is because I took Iron on an empty stomach or what.

I don't have lunch for today or tomorrow so I am going to be starving going home. I may have some stuff tomorrow depending on what we do for dinner tonight. I'm just eating the free snacks we have here. I didn't like anything on lunchdrop.

For now I am working on the [[Header & Footer#^65f842|Header QA]] that Alice gave me this morning. I am almost done. I plan to have that done today and fix up the footer tomorrow so I can move on from both of those by Thursday (I'm expecting her to QA the footer on Friday and find *something* for me to fix so that is Wednesday).

Obsidian is working well. I was thinking about having Josh's School in Obsidian but I can't do deadlines in Obsidian. I'm still trying to get help in the Dataview channel of the Obsidian server. By deadlines I mean having a countdown like this from Things 3:

I have a kanban with [[Math|Josh's Math]]:
![[Daily Notes/2024/01-Jan/00-assets/Math-Kanban.png]]
It looks SO GOOD and will work so well cause I can link all of the handwriting I do to each section. I just really like this part from Things 3:

So, I'm 50/50 between keeping everything there or moving to Obsidian. I just think it is A LOT easier for me to stay organized having everything inside Obsidian.

I'm also 50/50 between Apple Reminders & Things 3. I get Things 3 for free on Mac because I got it refunded but I have access to the Testflight. Will suck if I ever lose access to the TestFlight but for now it is awesome.

You can *kind of* get this in Apple Reminders. At least you can get the total number... but I can get that in Obsidian by counting.

Side note: Someone is walking around coughing. I hope they were smoking and that isn't a cold but now I hear someone blowing their nose so that doesn't bode well. I don't want to get sick.

Anyway, let's do a table to try and help me.

| Apple Reminders Pros | Apple Reminders Cons | Things 3 Pros | Things 3 Cons |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Free Always | No deadlines only do dates | Deadlines + Do Dates | May have to pay $50 for the mac version at some point. |
| Location based reminders |  |  | No location based reminders |
1pm: someone got back to me on the discord server and it is possible to have what I want in Obsidian. üòÑ So I added it and I have a print out [[Josh's School|here]]. Works well, I just wish I could show that on the Kanban... Well, I added it to Kanban and it worked. LOL Now I don't need it there but I am keeping it just in case.

Since I can do so much in Obsidian, I'm definitely an Apple Reminders user now.

I have even slimmed down all of my lists to look like this and that Expenses list will be moved over to [[Bills.loom|Bills]] and [[Subscriptions.loom|Subscriptions]] soon. I'll probably do that after work.

I don't need tasks for bills as long as I keep checking Obsidian. Which I will have a weekly reminder to check the [[Bills.loom|Bills]] file to make sure nothing is due and to update it. Will be part of my weekly review i plan to do.

GOD I LOVE OBSIDIAN. I AM OBSESSED! ‚ù§Ô∏è Okay, I gotta get back to work now.

Ok, last thing, I saw somewhere to have a scratch note open on the side of your Obsidian Window where you can quickly write things down. I liked that idea so I added it. I love how stupid simple Obsidian is.

I'm probably going to move all of my Quick Notes, to that scratchpad and have them all add the date beforehand. As of 1:35pm I have the shortcut set up and my workspace on my desktop perfectly. I **have to** get back to work now.

2:15pm: Set up a new theme. I'm obsessed. üòç

Mad Maniflow is the name. It is calmer and prettier than annuppuccin. I still need to set up headers and such but I'll do that later on tonight. For now, I am obsessed. üòç
![[Daily Notes/2024/01-Jan/00-assets/dark-mode-2024-01-22.png]]
Even dark mode looks amazing. YESSSSS.

3:30p: almost done with work. Writing this from my phone works so well.

Not using that theme on mobile cause you don‚Äôt get the nice look so I‚Äôm just using the default theme cause none are really as good. Sticking with default on my phone works for me.

# To Do
These are all the things I need to do to get Obsidian set up the way I want
- [ ] Move over Annuppuccin Custom Checkboxes
- [ ] Get Header colors going
- [ ] Get colors for **bold**, *italic*, ~~strike~~ (looks good), [external links](https://google.com) vs Internal Links: [[Projects]]... they should be easier to differentiate without the little icon. Plus other stuff in the [[Test Note]].
