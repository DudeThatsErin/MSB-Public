## 10:08am
I started my new job yesterday. It is nice though I am having issues and can't seem to find my boss, Kayla. She seems to be tied up in a long conversation. I am having an issue with the map where the map keeps making itself tiny and then bigger again. I have no idea why.

I'm back on Obsidian because it has more features than Apple Notes and is cross platform so I don't have to worry about how I will get tasks, images, or whatever into it. I'm still trying to decide between Reminders and Things 3 and using Obsidian for tasks but I'll leave that for later this month.

I am super tired since I started this new job but then I wake up at 9pm so I am wide awake and then I have issues falling asleep. It sucks. I may go to sleep tonight at 9pm so *maybe* I can feel rested tomorrow. It has only been 2 days (this is day 2) but I am tired of being tired.

I'm just going to walk on the treadmill when I get home for 45 min and then I'll continue working. Hopefully I can get this map thing solved. My Macbook is the 16" version of the one I had at Build Expo so that is nice. I feel bad for sitting here typing this right now but I can tell Kayla is still in a conversation. She talks a lot but that is whatever. She is super nice.

I may be pregnant and I hope I am. I need a break from my periods for a while lol I just want a baby, too. So does Josh. He keeps asking him to make him a kid and I want to but it is HARD.

Anyway, I'm going to brb and see if Kayla is done with her convo and at least go to the bathroom.

## 11:51am
Setting up my iPhone now. About to go home.

## 8:31pm
Getting tired, which is good. Maybe on Friday, I won't be tired. I should have exercised today but didn't. I plan to exercise for 30 min in the morning. If I get up right at 7am and change, I can exercise by 7:15 and if I do 30 minute fitness+ workout, then I will be done by 7:45 and I can jump in the shower and rinse off and *maybe* use conditioner (not shampoo, no time) and be out of the shower by 8:10 at the latest... oh... I guess I do have time for shampoo cause showering doesn't take me very long. Cool, I think that is a good plan, just means I have to sleep soon which isn't bad.

I just changed my template and I think this works better. All my metadata is at the top and the bottom is just for writing whatever the fuck I want.

Trying to decide on my task apps... Does Kanban embed? Let's see...
![[Task App(s)]]
Awww.... It does but only as a list. That sucks. It will be implemented in the future though

Now I want to change my styles as I don't like the yellow that is in the sidebar for daily notes. Turning off colorful frame cause it breaks when you split tabs horizontally (not vertically) and I didn't "need" it.

I switched from anuppuccin to border and I like this better. It has so many nice features that Anu doesn't have. Everything is super nice with a border around it, hence its name. If I don't like this I will choose a different theme.

I have to teach josh inverse functions and I barely understand them. I asked on reddit a month ago and taught him (barely a month ago) and it didn't help. I'm going to really try to learn them tomorrow cause I can't today. https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/1cz1kuc/how_do_i_explain_inverse_functions_to_my_husband/

Anyway, I'm going to go to sleep now. I'm tired. Tomorrow/Saturday I'm going to decide on my task app. I'm not sure which one. Good night!

Thursday
Week 1 of work, day 2 of work

P.S. Work is going well. 80% done of what they wanted me to do. WOO! :FarHeart: That is VERY good. I will probably have it done tomorrow AM first thing. I just need to implement addEventListener and then test it and *hopefully* it works.
