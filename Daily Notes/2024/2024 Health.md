Other notes: I had muscle pain when I woke up. Yesterday I woke up and had a horrible pain in my side under my left boob. I think I slept wrong. I am fine today though so that was super weird. I barely slept last night though and was barely able to focus so I barely got any Math done today. I was stuck in analysis paralysis due to my ADHD for most of the day.
