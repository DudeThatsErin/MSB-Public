## How have you felt today?
> [!info]- Use this chart
> ![[Emotion-Wheel-1.jpg|800]]

11pm: I haven't been in the mood for journaling because I have been thinking over my setup because I feel ashamed I spent the $60 for Obsidian Sync behind Josh's back. Obsidian can do some cool shit but Notion looks nicer and is free.

I can't store the tasks that matter most though.... Though at the same time, those tasks belong in something like Reminders.

BUT the whole point of using Obsidian or Notion is so that I only have to look at 1 app AND I have access to it on my PC. Cause I switched to Things 3 and other than the reminders on my lock screen (which don't change) I haven't opened the app or seen any of my tasks since Thursday, at least.

So, Now I have to figure out what I am looking for in an app and work backwards from there. Take it one step at a time. I still have 3 weeks to refund Obsidian so there is no rush, until then I can keep using Obsidian Sync to keep all my devices in Sync.

Okay, let's work on Step 1 of Task Management apps. I'm going to separate this.

# Task Management Choice
## Step 1 - What are my *must haves* in a task management app?
- Cross Platform -> Must be available on iOS & Windows.
- Free -> Eliminates any shame and lying on my side and keeps Josh happy.
- Ability to add tasks easily from desktop
- Reminders (notifications) on mobile
- Ability to add random recuring dates like for our trash -> Sundays through Thursdays
- Ability to see tasks in a variety of ways -> Kanban, List View, Calendar View, Table View, and Gallery View. Similar to how Notion databases work.
## Step 2 - What are my *wants* in a task management app?
- Quick add popup to add tasks (Todoist)
- Comments
- Web access (if I need to use Josh's computer)
- Any kind of attachment (vs Reminder's just image attachments)
- Ability to filter tasks to see only high priority tasks
- More than 1 priority level
- Markdown formatting or WYSIWYG editor.
## Step 3 - What 10 apps match the *must haves*?
This is best match to least match according to chat gpt which I agree with based on my knowledge.
1. **Notion**: Notion remains at the top spot due to its comprehensive feature set that includes advanced views, attachments, and flexible editing options.
2. **Todoist**: Todoist moves up due to its advanced views like Kanban and Calendar, which align with your needs.
3. **Microsoft To Do**: Microsoft To Do moves up as well for its attachment capabilities, making it a better match for your requirements.
4. **TickTick**
5. **Trello**: Trello gains a higher position for its native mobile reminders.
6. **Google Tasks**
7. **Any.do**
8. **Remember The Milk (RTM)**
9. **Wunderlist**
10. **Asana**

Certainly, considering your preferences, here are alternative suggestions to replace TickTick, Asana, Wunderlist, Google Tasks, and Remember The Milk:

1. **Planner by Microsoft**: Planner is part of the Microsoft 365 suite and offers task management features similar to Microsoft To Do but with a focus on team collaboration and project planning. It integrates well with other Microsoft products and offers various views and task assignment features.
2. **Quire**: Quire is a modern task management tool that offers advanced features like Kanban boards, nested tasks, real-time collaboration, and integration with other apps. It's available on iOS and accessible on Windows through web browsers.
3. **OmniFocus**: OmniFocus is a powerful task management app specifically designed for Apple users, available on iOS and macOS. It offers advanced features like customizable perspectives, defer dates, and task automation. While it's not available on Windows, it might be worth considering if you primarily use Apple devices.
4. **ClickUp**: ClickUp is a versatile project management tool that offers a wide range of features, including multiple views like Kanban, List, Calendar, and Board views. It's accessible on iOS and through web browsers on Windows, offering comprehensive task management capabilities.
5. **Taskade**: Taskade is a collaborative task management tool that offers various views like List, Board, and Mindmap views. It's available on iOS and accessible on Windows through web browsers, providing a flexible and visually appealing interface for task management.

These alternatives provide a mix of features and platforms to consider, ensuring you find the best fit for your task management needs. Let me know if you'd like more information about any of these options!

Honestly, seems like Todoist is the best option for me. If I am willing to spend $60 on 1Password then what is another $36 on Todoist. $100/year is 27¬©Ô∏è a day. I'll 100% decide once I do my note taking app.

# Note Taking App/Journal App
## Step 1 - Must haves
- Cross Platform -> Windows & iOS
- Ability to handwrite/draw with Apple Pencil, even if that means it is on a PDF and isn't searchable (Obsidian looking at you)
- Ability to link notes together
- Reliable sync between devices (sync can be paid)
- Free -> Eliminates any shame and lying on my side and keeps Josh happy.
- Offline access so I can search notes, take notes, or journal offline
- Ability to copy links to notes to paste into task management app so I can open notes directly from task app on any device (custom URL scheme)
## Step 2 - Wants
- Ability to export notes to markdown or HTML or some format that can be used if the app gets discontinued so that they are available long-term.
- Ability to search handwriting
- Outline view of notes so I can easily jump between headings
- Custom look for the app either via CSS or built-in options
