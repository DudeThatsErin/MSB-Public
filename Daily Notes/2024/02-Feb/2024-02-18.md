## How have you felt today?

I've been pretty good today. Been playing Palworld. Migrated 95% of my notes from OneNote to Obsidian. The only ones left are ones that are in Apple Notes and I'll do that once I decide to open my vault on my iPad. Probably will be tonight since I slept most of the day today.

Still looking for a job but I have an interview on Tuesday [[2024-02-20]] and another one on Monday [[2024-02-26]] and another one on Thursday [[2024-02-22]]. The last place, I applied for 2 jobs and on Friday they emailed me back and said that they haven't heard back from either of the hiring people over it but I did the initial phone interview on Monday [[2024-02-12]]. 
That was at midnight (maybe 2am) last night. Stopped cause Josh wanted to go to sleep.

Today I've been so emotional. Last night was fine but ever since I woke up at noon I just can't stay away.
