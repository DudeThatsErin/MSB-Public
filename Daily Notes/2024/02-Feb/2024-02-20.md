It is 3am and Iâ€™m about to sleep but I was setting up Obsidian on my phone and realized I needed a pretty picture today cause I have A LOT I have to get done today. Iâ€™ll update after my day is over. I doubt I will be able to do much applying for jobs today but that is fine, I will just apply at extra tomorrow (Wednesday).  
Letâ€™s see how it goes. Good night for now! ðŸ’¤ðŸ˜´ðŸ›Œ  
It is 2pm now. I am in the car just sitting here at Joshâ€™s appointment. Iâ€™m sad because I started my period. Happy cause I donâ€™t have to work out today. Just mostly sad though. The icon really has my mood for today. Minimal looks good on my iPad. I need to add it to my iPhone but I canâ€™t be bothered at the moment. I ran out of water and it is like 78 outside. I know I can run the car but I am too lazy.  
I have several interviews for the next few days though. In fact, every day until Tuesday I have an interview. I hope I can keep scheduling them once a day to keep myself sane lol Though it would be nice to double up video interviews so I donâ€™t have to do my makeup as often.  
Time to go get josh!
