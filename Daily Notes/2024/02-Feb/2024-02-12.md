I had my interview today at 12pm for what I thought was a Senior development role. I did apply for that but they also applied for me for a marketing developer role. Basically what I was doing at Hometown Hero. Unfortunately, the marketing role is for 80-90k and we need 110k+. So I'm going to interview to practice and practice negotiating to try and get 110k+ for that one.

I am really trying for their senior developer role as that one pays 100k+. The recruiter is super nice.

Other than that, not much else happened today. I just played Palworld and applied for jobs and exercised. Was a pretty good day overall.
