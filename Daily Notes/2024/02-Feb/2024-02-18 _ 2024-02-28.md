I've been pretty good today. Been playing Palworld. Migrated 95% of my notes from OneNote to Obsidian. The only ones left are ones that are in Apple Notes and I'll do that once I decide to open my vault on my iPad. Probably will be tonight since I slept most of the day today.  
  
Still looking for a job but I have an interview on Tuesday the 20th and another one on Monday the 26th and another one on Thursday the 22nd. The last place, I applied for 2 jobs and on Friday they emailed me back and said that they haven't heard back from either of the hiring people over it but I did the initial phone interview on Monday the 12th. That was at midnight (maybe 2am) last night. Stopped cause Josh wanted to go to sleep.  
  
Today I've been so emotional. Last night was fine but ever since I woke up at noon I just can't stay away.  
  
Updating on 2/28 -&gt; I added the calendar to the right when I migrated back from Obsidian to OneNote. Easier visualization of the dates.
