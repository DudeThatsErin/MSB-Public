Hello,  
  
I have my new Mac set up. I'm still trying to decide between Obsidian and OneNote. This monitor is so big that when I type the screen wiggles, it is so annoying.  
  
Anyway, Obsidian is lagging when I scroll. You can read it to the right where I reported it to the dev team. So Obsidian is basically unusable for me if I am using a bluetooth mouse.  
  
This is my first day in the office and it is Thursday. Lmao. They don't have anything for me to do today. Also, the bathrooms are brokenâ€¦ of course they are.  
  
I was afraid my laptop would be locked down but I checked everything and it isn't. So now I have to also decide between Todoist and Things 3.  
  
I'm going to decide by recreating my VS lists in Kanban in Obsidian. I think that is the easiest way. That way I can slim down the "Which" section.  
  
So I ended up going home and now it is 10:30 almost and I can't sleep cause I can't decide on a note application though I believe I have almost talked myself into using OneNote. I am typing this from the web on my phone to test out the linking from the web. \[\[2024-02-02]] what? That didn't make a link? Wtf? So that is only on the mobile and desktop apps? That is crazy. Okay what about copying a link to a note, if I can I will paste it below. I can't move the cursor with the space bar on web either. Wow. Weird choices Microsoft.  
  
Nope can't even do it from the mobile web.
