Been a long time since we talked.

I have to type up an entry from around the n November but besides that I haven't really been for on myself and it has caused a lot of issues in my marriage because I'm pretty sure I have gone from 207 to 210+ since I last wrote in here. Josh ~~wants~~ needs me to weight for our sex life and I want need to lose weight. I jus have a hard time eating less. I was listening to self-help audio books but they became a trigger for me so I stopped. Starting I I plan to exercise @ least 30 min a day everyday an least 1-2 hrs 3x a week. My goal is 7.5hrs of working out a week MAX but averaging about 6 hour week w/ 3 1.5 hr days & 4 30 min days. My first 1.5 hr day is today. I'm going to run for he & do legs for the last 30 min. I won't be able tow tomorrow but that is fine. Tomorrow is 30 min arm and Saturday is 30 min abs. Then I will restart on except hr run & 30 min abs. My 30 min stuff plan to mix up but my 1 he will ALWAYS be r I just don't feel like I get enough out of runs unless are 45 mint and I'm not doing any 45 min work if I can help it.

Wow I've written ALOT already lot: I just so zoned in and this relieved so much from my head.

I've been doing SOME reflecting in the la few months and after reading Jeanette McCurdy's book. "I'm glad my mom died "I have realized the I can help my bingeing by identifying my feeling so I'm trying to do that 24/7 so I can be a better person. (wife, nicer human, etc.)

When I started writing I was feeling overwhelmed and stuck in an ADD. rut trying to decide b/wee Todoist & Things 3.

Now I'm still in that rut BUT I'm not overwhelmed I'm just tired from lack of sleep or @ least lack of restful sleep.

As far as my rut, maybe writing things another way will help me decide. I've tried pros & cons lists & they are no help SO let's try this.

I'm going to focus on why I don't want to use either one first as that's where my mind star

I don't want to use Todoist even though I have a subscription until Sept 20, 2023 because I know I will have to change around that time and switching is a hassle that brings me anxiety that I will forget/lose a task. huh... it is all about my anxiety... I didn't realize/know that.

I'm going to get passed that anxiety by going @ it head on. I'm using Todoist until Sept 1-ish and then switching back to Things 3 (or Reminders if it has gotten any better by then which I _highly doubt_.)

This way Josh is happy that I didn't waste $ on a subscription AND there are no more subscripts for these apps in the future.

Hopefully my next job provides me with a Mac. that would be nice especially if it isn't locked down like my current HP laptop.

Speaking of jobs, gotta get back to mine.

Thanks for this clarity.
