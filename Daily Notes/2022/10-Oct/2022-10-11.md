# Hello,
I'm @ work right now and it is relaxed but I am so stressed out. I have so much to do until the end of next year. I am basically going to school for Josh while also working full time and keeping my marriage together. I _NEED_ to lose weight but I don't have time. When I get home I'm going to be doing Josh's spanish work until I go to sleep. The same thing for tomorrow. I'm still getting a lot of work done @ work but I am also spending time @ work doing his school. I could wake up @ 5/4:50am Tuesdays - Thursdays but I did that today (basically, was only half asleep after that) and I am so tired. That is without working out. I can only imagine how cranky I would be if I were working out on top of that. Don't get me wrong. I _want_ to work out I just don't know how to fit it into my schedule when I have to leave the house for work. Mondays & Fridays I work from home so I can work out whenever. I've just been too lazy to do it and IDK why. I got so tired walking around the zoo yesterday and I am so embarrassed by it because I used to be able to walk miles in the heat to see Josh in AZ no problem. I want/need to get back to that. Josh is not attracted to me anymore. He says he is but he never wants to have sex (never initiates) and has told me on multiple occasions that he hates we can only do 1 position (prone) because of my weight. Me on top crushes (hurts) him and doggy isn't good for him cause he can't get as deep as he would like. So, I get depressed & lately I can't stop binging. I need to stop but I am trying to punish myself for my weight which isn't fair. I am in a vicious circle & because Josh doesn't believe in therapists, I can't get one. No matter how much I beg/plead. He wants me to lose 20lbs by his birthday & I don't know that I can.

Anyway, I have to pack up to leave now. Maybe I'll work out when I get home & work on his school tomorrow instead. We will see. I just hate this funk I'm in & I Have no one to talk to.
