Hello,

I am needing to get a lot off of my chest because a lot has been happening since I last wrote in here and I mean A LOT.

So let's go back to December when everything started getting really good. Josh was able to phase up from 4 to 5 the week that holiday block leave (HBL) started. Which means he was able to come home to the apartment on weekends, leave base on weekends, and be a somewhat normal person. He just had to go back every night to sleep there, which worked really well after HBL ended on Jan 2.

During HBL we went to Ohio so he could meet my extended family and we had a family get together since all of the Motyka's were up there. I love those so much. It was really fun. We opened Christmas Presents and had the game where you wear oven mitts and try to open up a really tough package with tape all over it. I ended up winning, it was a $25 Barnes and Noble gift card which we still haven't spent yet. We have no idea what we want.

Moving on, after HBL ended on Jan 2, we had a good 4 weeks of Josh coming home on weekends and going off base on weekends. It was nice. We had a few dates where we went to Texas Roadhouse, Applebee's, and a few other places. I also took him to Tucson a few times and we drove to and from Las Vegas to get to Ohio. That was interesting and a story for another time.

Life was good, Josh was moderately happy in his shitty situation but overall it was a lot better than before he phased up. This was until last week. On Wednesday, Jan 29, Josh had his 3rd VA Appointment for his ears as he has hearing loss from BCT. He took his roommate, Boswell. He finally got a good one, btw, and now he is leaving in 2 weeks. :'( Anyway, Boswell lost his Military ID and Phase Badge in his room and went into their room unauthorized to get them. Josh went to talk to AG (front desk people) and they told him to go in his room to get him. Josh was in his room for 3 minutes and then DS Huertas knocked on the door to check his room as Josh was trying to phase up to 5+ so he could live at home. Huertas comes in and just starts going off on Josh with DS Johnson laughing in the background and DS Draper just standing in the hallway. He is yelling at Josh for untrue things. He is saying stuff like "You were in your room all day today." and other stuff that I can't remember.  The main point is that he thought Josh was in his room all day and wouldn't let Josh explain what was going on and didn't want to hear Josh talk at all.

It turns out that AG told Huertas that Josh was in his room and when Huertas asked why they lied and said that he was in his room all day because AG didn't want to get into trouble. Josh went off on AG and so did other trainees because that was ridiculous.

Then Thursday, Jan 30, rolls around and I have a DR appointment to find out if there is anything we can do for my cramps that last all month long. Turns out it is either dehydration or constipation, so nothing but drinking more water. Which seems to have helped. So far this month the cramping has stopped (YES!). My DR app is at 9am and Josh calls me at 8am (I had my alarm set for 8:30am) and tells me that Huertas asked Josh to see him at 9 so that makes me even more anxious. I get to the appointment and we start having this convo:

J: No he just face me down is having me wait outside the office and is refusing to let me speak to the first sergeant.

E: Wtf. He can't refuse.

J: I'm going to contact the battalion EO wraps.  
He and Landrum were double teaming me.

E: Wow.

Wtf. I can come pick you up after.

J: I think you're giving me an article 15 with extra duty can you call Jack for me

E: Still waiting on the dr.

J: Can you call JAG for me

E: Yeah once I'm done

They will want to talk to you though.

J: I know we'll talk tomorrow when I'm off quarters over the phone or something

I explained myself and he still did this.

E: You don't want to come home? I thought you'd said you would want to.

I'm sorry. They are fucking assholes. I'd EO them today.

*I then texted my mom about this and she called me while I was waiting at the pharmacy. I walked outside and talked to her. She told me I should tell him to have him say multiple times that they are picking on him while he is disabled and that he needs to emphasize that with the EO guys.*

E: Before you EO let me call you.

I talked ot my mom and I need to tell you something before you do.

At the pharmacy now.

*A few minutes passes without a response* You okay?

*3 more minutes passes* Call me when you can please

*I call him and he hangs up on me*

J: I'm waiting to talk to the first sergeant honey it's a lot of stuff later

E: Okay I was just worried

Want me to come there once I'm done?

Btw sprained my ankle. So I'm taking today off cause I can't do arm exercises *Just did them 2 days before and my arms were still weak* My arms are still weak. I'm focusing on my arms from now on. Until my ankle is better. Tomorrow I'll do 2 hours of arms and abs. *Never actually happened…lol*

J: No stay home for now honey

E: Okay. I love you.

*an hour passes* Still at the pharmacy

I'm going home at 11:30 if they don't call my number by then. That's 2.5 hours waiting here. Miralax is not that important

You done yet?

*20 minutes passes* I'm home safely. I love you! (heart emoji)

Wtf is going on? 3 hours in the DS office? Damn. Can't wait to hear this story.

*7 minutes passes* I'm getting worried now. I love you and I hope nothing bad is happening.

If you show up here I'm gonna cry. Lol I have no idea what to expect.

He ended up calling me after about 15-20 minutes from that last text. He explained everything that happened. I have also learned more over the weekend and I'll explain everything later because it all builds on each other and it is easier to explain all at once than now and then again later.

So Thursday sucked and he didn't want to see me but I ended up going there and seeing him for a few seconds so that I could get all of his stuff that is contraband now:

- TV
- Computer
- All the wires for both
- Civilian Clothes
- Vacuum (he doesn't need it there anymore)

Not much but still took 3-4 trips both ways (into the car and out of the car).

That sucked and I cried a lot on Thursday and my binge eating has gotten worse. To the point where last night, I ate so much cereal and cake (that I baked Josh) that it came back up. Never have purged before last night and I didn't like it in the slightest. We are going to see Marianne (our therapist on base) on Wednesday at 9am (tomorrow) so that's good. Hopefully I'll get the binging to stop soon.

So Friday came and went and I didn't see Josh at all and then Saturday comes and his formation is at 9am. I finally have my sleep schedule normal where I am waking up between 8:30 and 9:30 (WOO!) and I wake up at 9:30 and see if he wants me to come and he said he isn't going to be able to see me today at all. He just replied with "Never" after I asked him when he wants me to come. He was being punished Saturday morning for a text that came in to the DS either that morning or Friday night. Or that's what the whole D Co thought anyway. Also, A Co was being punished and having extra formations as well. Everyone hated Josh and Josh was miserable because 95% of what the DS were saying was untrue. The only truthful thing they said was yelling at Josh for saying DS Baily and Draper were the only two nice DS. Makes no sense but the DS make no sense most of the time so that's meh.

Come to find out at 1pm formation that they were all being punished in D Co for being phase 4s and they wanted to "motivate" people to be phase 5 because if you are a phase 5 you won't get punished. I laughed so hard when Josh told me that. Like, wow. My dad confirmed over the weekend that this is normal and to be expected.

So after 1pm formation, everyone was fine with Josh again, which is good. He got happier because I was there and he could see me for the rest of the day.

Sunday, Feb 2 was his 26th bday. He was miserable and barely wanted to see me. We did see each other and both Saturday and Sunday we walked to the PX which is just over a mile away from his barracks. That was annoying that we couldn't drive but it was good exercise for me. Helped me lose another 2lbs. I saw him for an hour on Sunday and like 3 hours on Saturday before working both days. Saturday I worked 3 hours and made $52 doing Postmates (before tips). Sunday I worked 3 hours and made ~$20 (before tips). After tips I had about $85 deposited into our account. Pretty good for only 6 hours worth of work. He was happy about that and I saw him Sunday night to bring him free outback (my mom sent him a $45 gift card) and a Coldstone shake. Overall his birthday was good and it could have been worse.

So, over the course of the weekend I found out more about what happened on Thursday. So, basically, Huertas called him over to the DS Office. He went. Huertas started yelling at him and Landrum decided to chime in because he loves yelling at Josh. They gave him a "write up" (basically). I've inserted pictures of all of the "write ups" he got that day below. I don't think they are in order but that's okay. Anyway, during the first one, he disobeyed Huertas by not giving H his phase card and saying he wanted to speak to the 1st SG. He was being double teamed by both H and L and was flustered and forgot about the disagree box that you see on the second picture. Otherwise, that would have been done. He was finally able to speak to the 1st SG and the 1st SG threw out everything that happened on Wednesday (agreeing that it was ridiculous) but upheld the disobeying/disrespecting the NCO (Huertas). 1st SG said "You would want to take this as a lesson because in the civilian world if you were to speak to your boss that way you would have been fired." Josh just said "Ok" but was thinking "If I were treated this way by any other job not only would I have left after a month, I would have reported that boss and not had to deal with this for so long." We both agree that this was the most ridiculous thing that anyone could have said and now agree with my dad who said before Josh got in "The army is full of children." So many grown ass children… SHIT!

Also, that text that the DS received must have been a doozy because yesterday, the DS were calling people into their office trying to get sworn statements from them about Josh's conduct. The DS were trying to get Josh for anything that could stick: EO, Sharp (sexual assault/comments), etc. Anything that they could. Of course there is nothing to get him on but trainees were telling Josh crazy stuff like DS were asking them if Josh ever made sexual comments about DS Lisbey and all this crazy stuff. It was insane but I finally got Josh to stop talking to people (besides Boswell and myself) about what is happening with him and to not say anything about the DS where other people (besides the 2 of us) could hear.

Today, Josh visited the lawyers and they referred him to speak to someone in Equal Opportunity (EO). So Josh is going to call the Battalion EO reps and speak to them. Also, Josh is going to call the VA guy to get an update on his med boarding (medical discharge) process as he has no upcoming DR appointments scheduled so he has no idea what he needs to do next if anything. I also tried to get Josh an app with a therapist on base (away from the barracks) and he didn't want to go because and I quote "Then im not going I don't feel safe alone with army personel" So, we are sticking with Marianne for now. She does her job well so it isn't necessarily a "bad" thing per-say but I'd rather he get a "real" therapist that has transcripts so he can get a new one in Cleveland when we move there and doesn't have to start from the beginning.

Oh! Yes! I forgot I haven't told you this yet. We decided to buy my childhood home in Cleveland, OH from my mom. I'm going back to an old address and Josh and I saw it over the holidays. We lied to my cousin saying that I just wanted to show him my childhood home and we looked around at the status of the home. ALL of the wood around the home needs to be redone, carpets up the stairs need to be redone, some paint has to be fixed. All of the living room floor boards have to be done and the kitchen is terribly small so we would have to find out a way to add more countertops to the kitchen. Overall though, the house is in good shape and we are hoping we could get a good loan so we can remodel it (hire someone to do it) and get it done ASAP. We also need a new garage because the old one was falling apart before I left and so they had it knocked down.

I'm excited though (and so is he) to have our own home and to live near Robyn (he met her and her fiance). Turns out Robyn's fiance's bday is the day before Josh's. Same year and everything. Just Feb 1 instead of Feb 2. That is pure insanity. So that makes Josh the baby of our group. Hahahaha. Anyway, I'm excited to live near her for the first time since 3rd grade and to have an amazing time living there. All my family is there (besides my immediate family) and I can see my grandmother more often. :) We just keep looking forward to that.

Well, I feel better after putting all of this out there. I was going to blog about it but until Josh gets out I don't want to do anything to cause him more harm. So, I decided to write it in my diary so I could get it out of my system but not cause him more harm. :) Anyway, that's all for now. TTYL!
