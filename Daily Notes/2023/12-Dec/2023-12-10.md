# Todoist vs Things 3 vs Obsidian Tasks Plugin
I need to decide between these because I am tired of having both installed on my system or thinking about the plugin. I just need to use one so I can get on with my fucking life.

Table has the pros and cons in a general sense, more details are below the table.

## Why would I use ... ?
### Todoist
1. Cross platform & web access for when I use my Windows PC (infrequent so not necessary anymore)
2. Flexible with...
	1. Filters
	2. Sub-Sub-Sub-Sub-Sub-etc. Tasks that all function like main tasks
	3. Reminders
		1. You are able to have as many reminder notifications as you'd like.
3. If I wanted to use NLP to add tasks.
### Things 3
1. I use only Apple Devices and don't care about access on my PC or the web
2. I only need 1 reminder per task
3. I want something that is more reliable (syncing and bugs) and doesn't jip features cause I am using an Apple product.
4. I don't want to pay for my task management app (at least not a subscription for one)
5. I want to add links to my tasks quickly (quick entry with autofill)
	1. This works with most apps I use...
		1. Any browser...
			1. Safari
			2. Chrome
			3. Arc
		2. Obsidian
		3. Apple Mail App
6. I use Siri to add tasks.
### Obsidian Tasks Plugin
1. I don't want to pay for a task app.
2. I want something that syncs reliably (git) and is completely private to me.
3. I don't need reminders or don't mind using Apple Reminders for those tasks I do need reminders for.

#### How do I feel about this?
Initial thoughts: feel good, honestly. It doesn't have the most pros and has more cons than pros.

After 15/20 min: I'm not happy. Honestly, that last sentence is why. It isn't built for the way my brain works. I've tried to use it SEVERAL times and it just doesn't work.

##### How do I feel about winner 2?
Better. There are more pros than cons this time. It is cross platform and Todoist can do anything that Obsidian and Things 3 can. I am more optimistic about this. I'm actually very happy I don't have to change anything in the end and I am using something so extensive. We can 100% afford even $48/year even though Todoist gave me the $36/year price.

# Readwise + Reader vs Omnivore vs Raindrop
Not doing whether or not they work on all devices because they ALL work cross-platform.

| Useful Discord Bot - though I only use it on the Obsidian Discord so is it that big of a pro?     | $48/year or something close to that. no free option/tier.   | FREE & no paid option atm | No Discord Bot                        | FREE                       | Not open source                   |
| More features - can read articles out to you (haven't figured out how to get that to work though) | Not Open Source                                             | Open Source               | Looks worse with saving reddit posts. | Need to test reddit posts. | No Discord Bot                    |
| Works better when saving reddit posts... looks better.                                            | Annoying to use 2 separate apps... I don't even use Reader. | Offline access free.      |                                       |                            | Have to pay to get offline access |

## Winner
Omnivore because it is free, open source, and while it looks worse for reddit posts, I really only need to save the links to Omnivore so I can access them later.
