## How have you felt this week?

> ![[Emotion-Wheel.jpg]]

### Sunday
I feel Happy and specifically, Content, Proud that was I able to accomplish what I wanted today and inspired.
### Monday
I feel tired. I think it is because I binge ate this morning. I'm ashamed that I binge ate and then still ate Chipotle. While also lying to Josh about exercising. I am disappointed in myself that I felt the need to do that just because hew as sleeping.  I'm tired/sleepy cause of my hormones as well cause I am probably going to start my period soon. Should be this week.
I am also annoyed that I can't work on this discord bot even though I want to cause I can't figure out the answer to my question in [[Graph QL API Queries]]... I asked it on Discord yesterday but no one has responded and its been way over 24h. Sucks.
### Tuesday
#todo need to fix this wall of text
How do I not let job searches get to my mental health? It has been 2.5 months.... 5 interviews with 1 company (still waiting to hear back after a week and a half (as of tomorrow)) 1 interview with like 5 other companies and no dice for one reason or another. My resume is good. My portfolio is good. My interview skills need work but they aren't the worst I've seen. I could have sworn I got the job with the company that did 5 interviews. In the last one they were 100% saying things and acting like I was going to get it. Now the last email I got was on Friday and it just said "We are still coming to a decision. Have a good weekend!" That was after waiting a week from my last interview. I don't think I should email again. I don't want to pester them but they are waiting in limbo... for what? Either way.... I have zero clue what is causing me to have these issues and I have ADD so every denial feels like a rejection which I don't handle well AT ALL. I know it is all business and emotions don't mean anything but that doesn't help me not feel like crap or like I'm doing something wrong. I've been slacking the last month and only applying via ZipRecruiter cause I was so confident I was going to get this job and it is the same mistake I have made countless other times (doing this) but I can't seem to learn. I get cocky and then it blows up in my face. I only have 2 months until my lease is up and I have to go month-to-month and then my rent goes up by $400/mo... which this place isn't even worth but that is another story. I need a job within the next 2 months. I plan to get my sleeping schedule back on track (been waking up at 1-2pm lately) and calling from 8am-10am to places I applied at 2-3 days ago and then applying from 10am-5pm and then working out (need to lose weight on top of all this) but idk what else I can do to make sure I have a job in 2 months.
