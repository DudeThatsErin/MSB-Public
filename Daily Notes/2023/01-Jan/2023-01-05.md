Rewriting so it is searchable by Obsidian
P.S. I had to use a white background because the part with the arrow pointing to it, stays black on a black background. Sorry for the bright white light!

Hello Hi Hola!
I'm @ work rn but I'm taking some time to self-reflect because I realized on my way home last night (from work) that my struggle between Things 3 & Todoist is the EXACT same struggle I was having for YEARS back from 2019 and before and it related more to my depression than the actual phones themselves. I was shook last night when I realized that. So, I decided I would use Todoist & unsubscribe from any productivity subreddit(s) & youtube channel and go cold turkey like I did in 2020 with phones.

Felt OK last night. Exercised some (cause I was tired) and ate and focused on animal crossing. Now I'm back @ work and I think the office is a trigger for me. Unfortunately, it is one I have to  deal with. I believe that though because it all came flooding back this morning.

Let me first identify what I am feeling:
- overwhelmed by the amount of work I have to get done
- tired cause I didn't sleep til 12/1am
	- This is usually how it is on Thursdays though cause they are my Fridays and I can sleep in tomorrow.
- bored cause I just want to play ACNH but I can't.
- stressed b/c I worry when Josh will have a mental breakdown again. They are rough on me because he yells (loudly) and runs around and slams/slaps doors. We both get embarrassed by it but part of me feels that I get more embarrassed than he does. Simple because he still does it but he can't control it.

Rewriting this in OneNote to the best of my ability because I lost everything after that sentence. iCloud doesn't even have it at all. That's when Apple Notes really started lagging. How insane that it can't even handle a single handwritten note. I know it isn't my iPad either cause someone else pointed out the lag about a week ago on Reddit. I just had no idea it was also affecting iCloud backups. Glad I am using OneNote now and glad I have the option.

Anyway, let me try to recap what I said. I am going to use Things 3 instead of Todoist. Wasted $36 on a subscription on Todoist but it is what it is. Things 3 just functions better than Todoist and there are no subscriptions. There are some hassles I have to deal with but I am willing to deal with them.

Now I wrote my Productivity stack so it was written in stone. I will only change it if a major update gets released that requires a subscription AKA Things 3 -> Things 4 (if 4 requires a sub). Otherwise these are life:
- OneNote for Jounaling
- Things 3 for Tasks/Reminders
	- Apple Reminders for location based tasks (one-offs)
		- like "when I get home remind me to..."
- UpNote for all other notes besides journals (prefer the way it functions)
	- Only will switch to OneNote if it gets collapsible sections. This is my biggest issue. SO NICE!
BOOM! Done.

I credited Josh for giving me the push/ability to look inward and be able to figure out that this is a mixture of my depression and ADHD. I feel the fog (that is honestly what it feels like) lifting a bit every day. This journaling helps also.

Well I gotta get back to work & this covers it.
