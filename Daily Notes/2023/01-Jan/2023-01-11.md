# Well Well here we are...
Not sure why I wanted to write that in cursive but here we are lol

My depression is full force today. I am also tired as shit while working. I'm just feeling rather fat today.
Let's keep this going, I'm starting to feel better.

What else am I feeling (in _no_ order)

1. fat -> I ate candy & chips yesterday. I binged and I am still feeling ashamed.
2. hungry -> no breakfast ever
3. tired -> I'm getting used to waking up @ 5am.
4. lazy -> I need to work out but I don't wanna.
5. ugly -> I have 4 pimples on my face.
6. ashamed (linked to #1) -> of my binging

Overall, I'm in a good mood. Like I am smiling and want to dance my shame must be causing this.

Ok! I am DONE being ashamed. It happened & I can't change the past. Just make sure it doesn't happen again.

Why did I binge?
1. overwhelmed because I was out of the house for longer than I wanted
2. cravings
3. lack of self-control -> biggest part
4. self-sabotage -> Still working on why I sabotage myself so much.

Why do I self-sabotage?
(geez, this is a heavy day)

1. I don't deserve to be happy
2. I don't deserve to be married
3. I don't deserve to be fit/skinny.
_ALL LIES_
All comes down to getting in my head and look of self-control.

Now that I'm getting better @ identifying my feelings I am going to move onto my self-control issues.

My goals for this week
Wednesday, 1/11/23 (today)
through Wednesday 1/18/23
1. start running 2 miles/day
2. lose 1lb
3. decide on to do list app and stick with it without switching for 3 days straight.
4. quit on Andrew -> no time need to focus on me mentally
5. get out of my depression funk and start loving myself again.

I feel better naming these goals & writing everything. Thank you.

Love,
