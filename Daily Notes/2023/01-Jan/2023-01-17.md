Rewriting so it is searchable inside Obsidian.

# Hello :FiSmile:
I am so incredibly hormonal today. I can't even work. Been @ work since 8:30 and I've changed 5 lines of code total. I'm really feeling my ADHD/depression paralysis right now.

I'm STILL having issues with my task management system. I decided to use UpNote or OneNote for work tasks so I just need something for personal tasks. I may even use notes for my Projects like my Python bot or CodingHelp Bot. So that means I only _NEED_ it for reminding me of things like:
- doing stuff for Josh's school
- tasks around the home
- Shopping List(s)

So, I don't need anything extravagant but _SOMETHING_ is keeping from using a free option like Microsoft To Do or Apple Reminders.

So I know I said Things 3 last time _BUT_ I don't need Projects & Areas for anything but _MAYBE_ the shopping lists.

So... with Things 3 & Todoist out of the way @ least the ones I'm deciding on are free.

MTD would be nice cause I could enter tasks via PC though that isn't a necessity for these kinds of tasks.

AReminders makes sense cause I can use homepods/Siri to enter tasks which I do sometimes.

Honestly, AReminders is probably where I'll go.

I'm also going to keep my journals & notes here.
Probably going to move to OneNote from UpNote cause I use OneNote more and I hate having both open.

On another note, I haven't been able to exercise cause even with my most supportive bra, my boobs hurt. My hormones have made me so crazy this month. I was fighting with Josh over text and when I called him everything was fine. I am so crazy.

Anyway, I'm going to set up my notes and tasks.

# Love you!
