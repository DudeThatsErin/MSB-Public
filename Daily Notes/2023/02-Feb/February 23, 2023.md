Trying to figure out why description isn't able to see the symbols until after submitting. asked on cypress discord, waiting on response. I added all the symbols but the description line on them is what I am working on. As of 4:30pm - no response, [pinged again](https://discord.com/channels/755913899261296641/763114122065739818/1078427119706710118) to try and get one.

I was able to get obsidian set up perfectly on iPad, iPhone, & Desktop. I saw on a few obsidian videos to create daily notes and break them out into separate notes.

I want to also accomplish everything within Things 3 which is:
 - [ ] Litter Boxes
 - [ ] Set up cat feeder on phone
 - [ ] Workout for 30 min. -> I plan to walk because I only slept 5 hours and I don't have the energy to run.
 - [ ] Import [[Complete this for workâ€¦]] to Things 3.
 - [ ] Set up Projects & DTE Vaults on iPad & iPhone.
 - [ ] Set up Misc, Projects & DTE Vaults on home PC.

I hope I can accomplish this. I am feeling better (not as tired) since I got my note-taking and task management apps off my mind.

Testing changes on ipad. leaving the app after this period. sync works really well with the automation. ðŸ˜€
Ok, there are a few minor bugs but that is okay.

I guess these daily notes will serve as my journaling so I don't need a separate "journals" vault. I may decide to separate it at some point but right now (since I don't have many notes yet) I think this works.

I decided that any notes I need my apple pencil for, I will either A) Deal with Excalidraw or B) use Apple Notes. 

Testing sync from my iPhone now. Leaving the app after this period. OMG this works so well. <3 Shortcuts are love, shortcuts are life! Mostly the shortcuts + automations combo. Glad I have a solution for all of my issues!
