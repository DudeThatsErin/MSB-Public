![[2023-04-23-Copy.png]]
I keep checking back on my last analysis paralysis note here: [[2023-04-21]]

Things 3 is nice but I have realized that using  comments and having the ability to see my tasks/reminders hierarchally is super useful. I just feel guilty using Todoist even if it won't renew until September 19th of next year (2024) because I shouldn't have pro in the first place. Idk. It works the best for me though.

> [!info-darkb] writing this on [[2024-02-17]] and it isn't guilt, it is shame. I know that now from [[2024-02-16]].

I am also thinking about using UpNote for 90% of my notes and just journaling in Apple Notes cause OCR never has worked for me in OneNote and that is the ONLY feature (besides web clipper which I don't use since I learned about Raindrop.io) Not sure what I should do. Though I probably will switch both tomorrow.

Hopefully I get a good job soon. I'm tired of this. I'm also tired so I'm going to go to sleep.
