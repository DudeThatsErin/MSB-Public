# Journal

- [ ] image in Apple Notes
- [ ] Are these all even from today? They have the same date in OneNote under the name so I'm not even sure.

Okay, this is better, at least I have this option with my iPad while I have to deal with the lag. I hope the new iPad isn’t that bad.

Anyway, this is everything I’m dealing with:

1. Getting my cruise control fixed. - I haven’t called the dealership cause I don’t feel like fighting with them and they are so far away and I hate leaving the house so much that I can’t get myself to call them.
2. Getting an oil change. - Similar to the last one except I don’t feel like trying to find a place that is cheap.
3. Helping Josh with school. - He yells at me EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. And it puts me on edge just thinking about it.
4. Work. - Trying to make sure I get a lot done each day and I’m productive. Plus, trying to remember how much needs to get done and where I left off.
5. Allergies. - They are making me feel like shit. My eyes hurt when I blink, my nose is running and I’m so tired. Plus, I have to pick up prescriptions tonight and I don’t want to. I just want to go home. YES - Just got a text (when I got to #8 and was about to write that) saying 1 of the things for my allergies is out of stock. I don’t have to get them until tomorrow or Saturday now. :D
6. Working out. - I need to lose weight for my own health and so that Josh gets off my back.
7. Figuring out what to say to my boss when I ask for a raise & promotion and whether I should ask to work from home or not. - This isn’t happening until May but I am trying to make sure what I say is good and full proof.
8. Deciding whether we should move or stay. - We keep going back and forth on this but we need to know by the beginning of June cause if we are moving, we need to look for places.

Just those 8 things and that is a lot on its own. I can’t handle the world ending or any of the preparation stuff Josh is doing.

He wants me to ruin my next phone by using a pelican case that is ugly.

He wants it cause it is bullet proof and would be the most protective for our phones if the end of the world happens. I don’t mind having this case as a backup but I don’t want to use that case as my primary case. It would be annoying to use my phone and make the phone very bad to use in my hands. The Pro Max series is already really big in my hand and this will just make it worse. 

I shared screenshots of this journal entry with Josh cause I want him to read it. I was telling him I was overwhelmed so hopefully he stops talking to me about the preparation stuff he is doing. It will help A LOT. He can’t control the school stuff or much of the other things but he can help with the decision on whether we should move or stay and stop talking to me about preparation stuff. Maybe he will take the car in for an oil change. Even if he doesn’t, him stopping some stuff will help.

I still have to figure out how to handle the stuff for work. Idk I’m not sure I am going to continue working today after 1pm. I was thinking about staying until 5 but my eyes hurt so bad when I blink and moisturizing eye drops don’t seem to be helping. I think it is the lights in the office cause I was fine at home. I’m still deciding. Probably going to do it simply because I’m tired and overwhelmed and miserable. I just have to message Ken and ask.

Anyway back on task.. hehe Should I use Todoist or Things 3 ? Idk. I give up. I’ll stick with what I have and decide later. I can’t deal with this right now. My eyes hurt so much and my nose won’t stop running.

I’m just gonna work and stop journaling.

Another one from today

Excited for this new set up with Obsidian.

I realized that apple notes offers E2E encryption, the ability to work with the apple pencil and more so I decided to use the following as my setup and I feel like handwriting instead of typing so let’s switch over.

Several from today with images missing (supposedly)

my iPad is only @ 26% so I'm going to keep this short. I got everything migrated from Obsidian and Apple Notes & it feels amazing to be back and my mind feels clearer from this decision(s) I made tonight.

Anyway, I have to get Things 3 figured out then sleep.
