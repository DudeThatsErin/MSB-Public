Hi Hi!

So, I just got the iPad Air on Saturday. Took itself to decharge 2 days. I realize I haven't purchased anything big for 3 months as well as talked in here. I was busy working on school, playing with my iPad & deciding between the S4 & iPhone . With the iPad (since it syncs iMessages) I decided on the iPhone. I figured out that it is 50/50 w/the people I text vs iMessage. I was supposed to go to field experience/observance @ Autauga Christian Academy today but I needed another day off both that & work so I could relax & finish school. SO, htat's what I did today. I finished my whole math class today. I got an 86.4% in the class. I tried to work on my education classes but I am getting a weird redirect error. So, I am going to check on it again later but for now I am relaxing. Just glad that my class load has gone down from 4 to 3. I go on vacation from work starting next Saturday (11/13) so I plan to completely finish all of the classes for Fall 2013 then. (: My degree will get mailed to me. So happy!

I also got my first raise @ work but I can't tell any of my coworkers. Since I can't I keep forgetting to ask my manager (Tyneka McCall aka Ty) how much it is. Oops! I have also been working for Woodforest for 1 year as of yesterday. So surreal. Though I am jealous of Trip cause I found out that before he got promoted to Assistant Branch Manager & xferred over to Eastern Blvd that he got another raise. I know I am not supposed to know but Ty told me. I was & still am shocked that he could have those pics but yet not talk to me like we were close friends. That is sooooo messed up.

Since that is the case I am trying my best to not text him @ all. Though I have been slipping recently I still try to only keep the talk work related so another blow up doesn't happen.

Dante added me on FB w/a friend request I sent a few months ago, yesterday. Then I saw he is getting pedo-like cause he is hanging with w/a girl that graduated w/Kaitlyn (2013) & he is 21. That is ridiculous, imo. He & Trip need to get it together. Seriously. Anyway, it has been 1-2 months since I texted him last. So happy w/out him in my life.

Glad to have Robert Brown or Rob in my life. He gives me hope that there may be good guys out there. Just not here in Montgomery/Prattville, AL. I may have a small crush on him but Idc much cause the guys hhave hurt me so much that falling for someone seems ridiculous & I am just happy being single. Plus, he doesn't want to date & doesn't have time to date right now. I respect him so I am giving him space & food. Lol! Seriously! I brought him Subway on Monday. He was shocked and texted me that he loves me. Idk what to think of that but I just don't cause I am so broken.

Well now I am grabbing something to eat cause I Have a hunger headache that is getting to annoying. Talk to you later gator!

Hello,

I was really thinking about what I wanted in a device so I decided to make a new list. I used my older list only after I ran out of my own (new) ideas. After filling up this page I still don't know what to do with my phones.

Great Grandma Motyka is on the phone. Ugh. I hate talking to her. She is a bitch.

Well! Before I start ranting about everything I am going to finish writing this. TTYL!
