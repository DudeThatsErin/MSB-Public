Hello,
So, I just purchased the Samsung Galaxy S4 from T-Mobile with a $0 down payment & I am starting to regret it. Not only b/c I just got the iPhone 15, well now 16, days ago but b/c the phone itself is not as good as the iPhone. I decided that since I couldn't sleep I would decide whether or not I wanted to return my Galaxy S4. I think I have official decided to which makes me happy b/c this was just a bad idea all around.

Well, I am going to turn off my phone & reactivate my iPhone.

I'LL TTYL!
