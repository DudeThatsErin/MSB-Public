# These are the ones I sent him while he was in basic.
Hello Josh!

First, I love you! It is day 2 of you @ basic. It is the day they took your phone away from you. I hope they didn't run you too ragged so far. I know you can do it though. You are the strongest man I know. I got inspired to write this because I found a military wives subreddit. They said I should start writing now so I am.

I have decided to cancel that YouTube channel idea because I'm not a doer, I'm a watcher. I prefer to watch the videos, not make them.

Instead, I'm getting into dancing. If my handwriting is messier than normal that's why. I started dancing 30 min-give or take-ago and I already feel back to myself. I was starting to get back into my depression. I prevented that with my dancing. I’m nowhere near good but I'm hoping this plus walks with Marli (maybe not as long as 1/5 miles since I’m dancing) will help me stay my happy-healthy self.

I randomly had this idea before I was listening to my music & instantly fell in love as I never get a chance to dance normally & I can dance anywhere, anytime. Perfect!

Anyway, not much to say in this letter as I talked to you today. I'm not sure when you will get this but I hope you are well!
<3 With love,
Erin Skidds

Hey hubby! <3

I miss you and love you with all of my heart. Nothing will ever take me away from you except Fernando. Bye! JK! Lol

I wrote this letter earlier but I had to rewrite it because I have some awesome news! I have no idea if I am pregnant.

So, today is your first night @ camp & my first official night without you. At first when I got home I sobbed like a baby for 2 hours. In the bath, hugging stitch, etc. I finally calmed down enough & relized I had to use the same grieving patterns I used for Tessie with you. With her I moved my bed by the window and named a star after her (no idea which one, just a bright one) and anytime I felt sad, I looked up @ it, cried a bit, & told myself she is watching from heaven or w/e is up there.

Now, you aren't dead but besides these letters you might as well be until June. AH! ZOMBIE! SCARY! Lol Anyway, I did the same as you & changed my wallpaper. I changed it to the one Kaitlyn photobombed. Lol Now when, I'm said I can look at my phone & talk to you. I also decided I can't watch those videos you recorded because they make me so sad.

If you can't tell by my writing. I finally feel like myself again. I was laying in bed after changing my wallpaper & wanted to dance. So, I did. Hardcore for 52min, according to my fitbit. HOLY CRAP! I decided I'm doing this every day until June when I see you again. You have bootcampe & now so do I just not as bad as you lol

I decided to weigh myself tonight. I had to do it twice because I was shcoked as I've been feeling fatter lately. No wonders as to why… lol I am 202! I weigh the exact same as I did on March 21st. I have not gained a single lb! I am SO HAPPY! Thank you for making me the best version of myself. I know now that with my bootcamp I am gonna be 190 or lower by the time you see me next. I am SO HAPPY abou tthat and I couldn't have done this if you didn't instill these values into me. <3 Youa re definitely my better half! Sexier one, too! :)

It is after midnight now so I'm going to sleep! Sleep well& I hope they aren't causing you too much pain!

<3 With love,
Erin Skidds aka Wifey

Hello Josh!

So, I decided to pack all of the first letters together since I don't have your address yet. I also decided that even if we talk I'm going to write you once a day while you are at boot camp. So here comes 72 letters! Lol It is like HP when the letters attacked Harry to send him the Hogwarts invitation! Lol

Today was better than yesterday. I only had 2 crying spells today. One after you called (given) and another just 30 min ago. Kaitlyn, Jamie, & Dean & I went out to Applebee's today. It was nice to get out of the house & my own head. ON Saturday Kaitlyn & I are going to COSTCO & Them Jamie is joining us @ the beach. I desperately need to go to Ohio though as I need to get out of the state. I'm going to see if I can afford it and maybe take off work from the 28th - 4th so I can be in Ohio helping with their wedding stuff. I’d be busy and out of the state. I want to make sure I use as little as I can of that $1k my mom gave us though. I'll let you know if I decide to do that. :)

I did more dancing today & now my ass hurts. Lol I really hop ethis helps my mind & body.

Well it is after midnight AGAIN. Idk why I haven't been sleeping because I'm so depressed that I just want to hibernate until June 15th I can last a week but 70 more days?! UGH! I just want a hug or kiss. Is that too much to ask the world? I guess so…

Anyway, time for bed before I break down again. Night!
~ Love with all of my heart & soul,

Hello,

I will always start my letters off with I love you because I do.

I wanted to write to you again today because I've had a break through with the help of my mom. I needed something to fill my time and she brought up cleaning the house. Ordinarily I would complain but seeing as I have nothing better to do, I have decided to do it. Crazy, huh? So every inch including the indoor/outdoor room is being cleaned. I'll have another go ! The wall with the ball marks on it. Lol As you can see I'm desperate to fill my time. So far I've done the kitchen, that includes organizing all but one cabinet, the dishes. Cleaning the thing the silverware goes into, cleaning the drying rack, the countertops & the stove. I still have the floor, that one cabinet, the microwave & oven. So, this is a lot more work than I thought & I am happy it is. Also, I'm definitely going up to Ohio the 17th-5th to help w/wedding stuff & get out of the state. That will definitely help time go by faster w/cleaning b/c inevitably the vacuuming, swiffering, and dishes & counters & more will need to be redone when I get back.

I'm looking forward to how shocked you are about the house when I get back. It is going to be a WTF moment. Ugh. I cannot wait to see you again.

Anyway, I just wanted this to be a shorter one. Talk to you in the next letter.
Love you! Miss you!
Wifey
P.S. I hope you don't mind but I'm *barely* talking to Dante again. If you want me to stop I will. I just miss having a guy to talk to in real time… even if he is a douche.
