Today has been hell since i got home. I did well at work but as soon as I got home, Josh wanted to learn math after I showered and I didn't even get a chance to cook food. I tried to teach him and then he had a mental breakdown cause he couldn't understand it. He then said hurtful things like how I am not enough for him to live and that I don't love him. He got so upset over nothing. It is so bad and so I am upset.

He is in bed probably on his phone right now and I am tempted to get a milkshake but I am trying to be good about my weight cause I really do want to lose weight. I am so upset though and food makes me happy**
