I'm so annoyed. Since I am on the iOS 18 beta on my phone, Apple is refusing to help me and LifX won't help me either. I realize 18 is a beta version but I went back to 17 already and did DAYS worth of troubleshooting that didn't help in the slightest.

I can't get the lights to work in Apple Homekit. Oh well, I'm going to leave them be, because they aren't flashing or anything, they just don't work in Homekit. Hopefully if I keep them there and don't change anything, they will work once iOS 18 releases. Until then I'll just turn on/off the living room light for Josh. He is okay with it.

I was very productive yesterday as far as work goes. I'm annoyed about work too cause my paycheck may be wrong due to taxes and that is ALSO super annoying.

I created a new homepage...

Hopefully it will help me be productive. I am thinking about adding my tasks but I am not even sure if I want to use Obsidian. I am only using it for now because I was stupid and got Obsidian Sync and I can't get a refund for it.

I guess I could just use it for work notes and projects instead of these notes. Also, databases. Stuff that I don't mind switching to github in a year.

You know what, yeah, that's what I am going to do. I'm going to create a new vault and use it for ONLY work and such. Let me move this daily note to Apple Notes.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I switched to Apple Notes again. This is where I want to stay. It is free and just works well. Super tempted to see if I can figure out what is going on with local so I can use the beta on my MacBook. You know what I am going to. I don’t have anything to lose. I pushed to wp-engine so I can always clone. This is a good way for me to make sure all of that is working.

My goal is to use all apple stuff so that it is free.

I am still using Obsidian for some stuff so my $47 is not going to waste. So, I am happy. I can use both.

Oooh… Pronotes on MacOS is SOOOOO useful and 90% of the reason why I am 100% okay with using Apple Notes vs Obsidian. It adds backlinks and such.

I’m going to be making my own task management/note taking app and that will be super nice. Pronotes, though, creates a few bugs but overall not many.

I was able to insert that second divider by just doing `/divider` and that inserted those plusses because I have 
 which is just that. A template with a divider. It has AI features added in for gold but I prefer the way Apple is going to do it in 2025 where I can optionally add things to ChatGPT but the rest is processed all on-device.

Also, I just realized I was only using Obsidian due to “sunk cost fallacy”… My “sunk cost” was literally the COST of the subscription that I won’t get back. So, I’m not going to use it. I’m going to use Trello until my note-taking app is good enough to where I can use that.

Anyway… I was also thinking about using Todoist but I am trying to get myself NOT to use it due to the subscription. 

I just need to add the features I am missing to my task management app and NOT use Todoist. It will give me motivation to make my task app. For now, I am going to use Trello and Things 3.
