I’m so angry right now. Josh could have waited until tomorrow to get Chipotle. Today I am fasting for the rest of the day on purpose to try and finally lose weight. So, I am hungry and he knows that. He went anyway. FUCK. I also have to finish 2 pages between today and tomorrow and I’m not going to be able to do that. I think Kayla knows that. I’m going to be working until 8pm again and I just want to cry. I am so miserable.

I felt fine about myself today. I lost like 2lbs so far and Josh didn’t acknowledge it when I texted him.

No acknowledgement at all. Then at work they had ice cream cake that I wanted but couldn’t have and as soon as I got home Josh is immediately talking about my weight. I am so upset.

I can’t even cry. I want to but I can’t. I am so hungry. So fucking hungry. Food is the death of me.
