## Misc

- [ ] # Excalidraw
	[[Procrastinotes App.svg]]
- [ ] # Later (after main app is made for ME)
- [ ] Logo that has the O in the name being a face with a question mark like Josh had the idea of.
- [ ] # Main Site
	## Domain Ideas
	- Procrasti.notes
	- Procrastinotes.com (100% buying no matter what)
	- Procrastinotes.dev
	- Procastinotes.beta (80% buying for dev site)
	- Procrastinotes.md
	## Use Hostinger
	No reason to not use my existing hosting.
	
	## Make it super simple
	Use my existing publish solution to make a simple site as another example of a site that can be made with it.
- [ ] # Support Methods
	## Tickets
	Possibly use a ticketing system like OSTicket for support. Makes it easy to keep track of emails and such and hire freelancers to help out. Rather than needing emails.
	### Emails
	Emails are a backup BUT primary is Tickets and Forum & Discord Server
	## Forum Site
	Similar to Obsidian's. Maybe use the same software?
	## Discord Server
	https://discord.gg/HQ4VkpKeDF
	
	- [ ] Make Banner
		- [ ] Animated
		- [ ] Non-Animated
	- [ ] Create Channels
	- [ ] Create Bots (Similar to CodingHelp but more moderation)
		- [ ] Make one like Obsidian's as well.
		- [ ] Except Ticketing Bot, just use the one CH does. Need to put more work into App.
- [ ] Encrypted syncing solution like Obsidian Sync
	
	Also, the ability to sync with any solution that you choose as well. Starts as 100% offline and then you decide from there.
- [ ] Publishing Solution like Obsidian Publish.
- [ ] # Hub Website
	Hub Website that works similar to Obsidian's were other people can help updated it. Use the software I use to publish to make this site so I can make it in a separate "notebook" aka vault.
- [ ] # Connect to 3rd party apps:
	- [ ] Omnivore
	- [ ] Readwise/Reader
	- [ ] Raindrop
	- [ ] Pocket?
- [ ] # Pricing
	100% decision later, this is just a thought.
	
	Pricing is for syncing and more premium features that I have to pay for like Weather, Email Notifications, and Syncing and Ai.
	
	I need to make sure One-Time covers 100% of my annual costs (break-even) per person and monthly covers 120% of my annual costs (to make up for one-time purchases), this is where I make my money.
	
	## One-Time
	$80 for all Apple apps & Web
	If Cross Platform:
	$80 for Web & Android & Windows
	$130 for ALL.
	
	## Monthly
	$15/mo Web only
	
	$20/mo for Web, Windows & Android
	
	$20/mo for Web & Apple Devices
	
	$40/mo for All
	
	Maybe add AI as a separate subscription addition.
	
	Publishing is a separate cost.
	
	## Yearly
	$170 for Web Only
	
	$220 for Web, Windows & Android
	
	$220 for Web & Apple Devices
	
	$260 for ALL.

## Backlog

- [ ] # Do these in this order
- [ ] ## iOS/iPadOS App
	Everything that can be done on the Mac App just translated over.
- [ ] Implement all of my plugins from Obsidian
- [ ] ## Web App
	Written in React. Everything on Mac App translated over
- [ ] ## Windows App
	Written in React. Translated from web
- [ ] ## Android
	Doing this last after every other app is done
- [ ] # After my basic app is done...
- [ ] Allow other people to create plugins and use a setup like Obsidian
- [ ] Ability to integrate with ChatGPT or Copilot or Google's AI (or all 3) but options to turn it off in the settings. Defaults to off.
- [ ] # After everything above is done
	Add whatever features are left
	
	Create Websites & Support Sections AFTER all features are added.


## In Progress

- [ ] # Basic Mac App
	Using Swift write a Mac-only app (for now) that allows me to TYPE text only and is a WYSIWYG editor and has a source mode.
	
	Obsidian's BASIC app (how it functions) with ZERO plugins (not even any of their plugins) is how I want it to work.
	
	## Featuers to Add...

- [ ] Tasks (no notifications just basic check/uncheck)
- [ ] Formatted Text
- [ ] Kanban
- [ ] Code Blocks
- [ ] Callouts
- [ ] Collapsible Headers
