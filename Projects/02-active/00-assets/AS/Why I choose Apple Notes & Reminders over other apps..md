This is something that I have been deciding for a while now. I like testing out productivity applications and I have tried them all. For my personal devices I use a Windows PC (sometimes) and a 12.9” iPad Pro and an iPhone. My iPad Pro works as my laptop which is the primary device I use for taking notes, drafting these blogs, and keeping track of my life with reminders/tasks. Having ADD this is something that I *need* in my life. With that said, let’s get into the reasons why I chose to use Apple’s software instead of other options.

## Pros of Apple Notes & Reminders
Apple Notes and Reminders work the best when you’re re within Apple’s walled garden. They sync with Siri super easily, they are able to be used on an Apple Watch (reminders is at least) and you can link to notes as well as emails by dragging (or sharing) the note or email to Reminders to get a nice looking like back to the mail or notes app.

Apple Notes & Reminders also work best with the Apple Pencil which, even though I’m no artist, I use the Apple Pencil almost every time I am on my iPad. You can handwrite notes in Apple Notes or Reminders in Apple Reminders with Apple’s “handwriting to text” feature which works surprisingly well even when I am traveling (as a passenger) and writing notes in the car on a bumpy road.

You can also add reminders or notes via Siri so when I am driving if I have something I think about I can quickly create a note or reminder with my voice.

The next feature I use is one that I will describe because I don’t know if it has a name for it. You can take the Pencil and with the iPad off you can tap on the screen (once) and it opens a new note. You can even change the settings in the settings app so it opens a “daily” note, that being a note that resets daily so you can keep a log of your notes. Also, you can (with the screen on) take your pencil and drag up from the bottom-right corner of your screen to open Apple’s new “Quick Note” feature so you can take notes from the web, share links (as a read-it-later service) or doodle. Anything you can do in the full-fledged Apple Note’s app works as a quick note. All of your quick notes are stored in a quick notes folder in the app so you can access them all from the app to sort later.

The most important feature, for me, is the end-to-end encryption that Apple now provides via “Advanced Security” in the iCloud settings. Turning that on makes all of your apps E2E encrypted so anything stored on the Apple servers can’t be used for data collection and cannot be read by anyone but you. This is important as I have digitized all of my journals and, while they do not have any trade secrets in them, I prefer to keep them between me and me. I don’t need random people knowing my embarrassing secrets from 3rd grade (just an example). I don’t know of anyone that would want that kind of stuff read by random people.

This is small but the apps are **free** and while it is a small feature to me, that may be a big feature to some other people.

Overall, there are a lot of nice features that aren’t available in any other application because of how tightly wound stock applications can be in the Apple Ecosystem and how limiting Apple makes it for 3rd party developers. For example, no app is able to create a custom control center toggle. That would be a cool feature but that is limited to stock apps like Apple Notes.

## Cons of Apple Reminders & Notes
These stock applications do not have as many features as any of the 3rd party applications that I have tried out in the past. This is something I am able to get past that because of the E2E encryption that Apple provides and how much more important that is to me versus any other feature and why that is important to me.

Some features that may be important to other people and that I wish Apple Notes & Reminders had is:

- Markdown support. It would be nice to have more formatting options. So: *this* would become *this.*
- Export/Import support via iPad. Not a lot of apps have this but it would be a nice feature if I could export to markdown or some other format so if I am switching to/from Apple Notes/Reminders I could do it A LOT easier than manually moving everything around.
- Callouts/Drop Down boxes. I use these a lot when I am using UpNote & Obsidian. They make your notes look SUPER nice and you still have access to that information but it can be hidden when you don’t need to see it.
- Sub-Sub-Sub-Sub Tasks OR at least Sub-Sub-Sub tasks. Meaning you have Task A that can be sectioned off to Sections 1, 2 & 3 and then each of those sections have tasks A, B, C, etc. This is something you can do with Things 3 & Todoist but not with Microsoft To Do & Apple Reminders.
- More heading & text formatting options. Apple Reminders & Notes is severely lacking in formatting options. As far as I’m aware Reminders doesn’t have any formatting options you can apply and Notes is very limited.
- Better Windows PC support. This is never going to happen BUT one can dream, can’t they? The current implementation is severely lacking. At least it is there at all but I would almost rather it not be there.
- Headers/Sections in Apple Reminders. This would make it a lot easier to separate tasks instead of having to create separate lists and group those lists together to make those sections. The list sidebar would be a lot smaller for me.

Most of these have to do with Apple Notes as Apple Notes is the one that is lacking more than Apple Reminders. I wish these apps had these features as it would make them more appealing to more people. In their current implementation, they are hard to recommend to most people. Their features are extremely basic and not made for power users.
