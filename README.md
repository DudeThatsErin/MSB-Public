# My Public Vault
This is my demo Obsidian vault. This demo vault contains all of my templates, plugins, theme(s), and snippets she uses as well as the exact folder structure I use on my Obsidian Vault.

I migrated my README to my blog. You can check it out [here](https://techbyerin.com/dudethatserin/My-Obsidian-Setup-8e7961e46220452aa80d8c86b54bed28).

## Screenshots
