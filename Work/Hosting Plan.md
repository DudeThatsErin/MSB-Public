# Features
Includes 600k files. We use 150k on our dedicated server and 500mb (way less) on our Dreamhost hosting.
CDN is included for free.
Both have unlimited bandwidth.
Free emails and from my experience I've never missed an email.
Daily backups.
Free SSL
Faster speeds for loading up wordpress sites.
Can use PHP7.3/7.4 or older (down to 5.2) for free. Eliminates that cost as well.

Hostinger doesn't have priority support though I have never needed that. They have 24/7 chat and any downtime I have had, has just been scheduled maintenance and I was aware of it beforehand.
HPanel is easier to navigate than both dreamhost's and ionos'.

Overall, I find Hostinger A LOT better than ionos or dreamhost.

# 4-year Price
It is MUCH cheaper than $150/mo for dedicated server + $15/mo for shared hosting. We could consolidate.
