These are things I want to remember for the terminal

`flutter doctor -v` verbose flutter doctor to detect issues
`open -a Simulator` + Command Shift 2 to change to x64 which covers iPhone 5s or later.
`flutter run` to run applications
`pub get` Updates flutter shit
`flutter clean` to clear cache and weird stuff
# Aliases
`fd` flutter doctor
`fdv` flutter doctor -v
`beu` cd dev/app/buildexpousa
`fr` flutter run
